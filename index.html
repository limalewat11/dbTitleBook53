The world&#39;s financial system will need to find a new anchor before the year 2020. Since the beginning of the credit crisis, the US realized the dollar will lose its role as the world&#39;s reserve currency, and has been planning for a monetary reset. According to Willem Middelkoop, this reset will be designed to keep the US in the driver&#39;s seat, allowing the new monetary system to include significant roles for other currencies such as the euro and China&#39;s renminbi. Prepare for the coming Reset In all likelihood gold will be re-introduced as one of the pillars of this next phase in the global financial system. The prediction is that gold could be revalued at $ 7,000 per troy ounce. By looking past the American &#39;smokescreen&#39; surrounding gold and the dollar long ago, China and Russia have been accumulating massive amounts of gold reserves, positioning themselves for a more prominent role in the future to come. The reset will come as a shock to many. The Big Reset will help everyone who wants to be fully prepared. This fully revised edition of Middelkoop&#39;s book takes into account developments since its original publication, which have only strengthened the case for the coming return of gold.</p><p>Willem Middelkoop (1962) is founder of the Commodity Discovery Fund and a bestselling author, who has been writing about the world&#39;s financial system since the early 2000s.

She lives with her family in northern Virginia.A Great Beginning<br><br>Learning good manners will help your child act toward others with respect and take into account their feelings. Your child will also gain the confidence that comes from knowing the proper thing to do. As a parent, you're sure to discover it's a gradual process. While your children will put into practice a few good manners, you'll need to remind them often of others. Start with the basics, and enjoy the journey together!<br><br><i>January 1<br>How early should you start teaching manners?</i><br><br>Parents begin teaching manners by example as soon as a child is born. While our children might do what we say, they are more likely to do what we do. First-time parents may find it shocking to hear their child spout an off-color phrase she learned from a parent. Whether we like it or not, learning usually takes place in the home, through imitation.<br><br>It's a good idea to teach your child one new chore each year. If a child learns to make a bed at age three, at age four he can begin emptying the wastebaskets, and by five start to set or clear the table. Try a similar approach with manners. Teach your child a few manners--and when he's mastered those, start on a few more. Lay a foundation and begin to build on it. Expect basic manners from a five-year-old, and more from a ten-year-old. You'll be amazed how many compliments you'll get by the time your child reaches adolescence.<br><br>A three-year-old should:<br><br>- Establish eye contact when speaking to another.<br>- Say hello.<br>- Wash hands before and after a meal.<br>- Stay seated during the meal.<br>- Use utensils at the table.<br>- Say "please" and "thank you."<br><br>A ten-year-old should:<br>- Be able to hold a conversation with an adult.<br>- Use good table manners.<br>- Answer the telephone properly and take careful messages.<br>- Show self-control in public places.<br>- Take responsibility for keeping the bedroom neat.<br>- Stand when an adult enters the room.<br>- Know how to be on time.<br><br>A fifteen-year-old should:<br>- Initiate conversation and show interest with adults.<br>- Pick up after herself and her friends at home.<br>- Maintain a noise level that is acceptable to the family.<br>- Be protective and kind toward younger siblings.<br>- Express appreciation to parents and others.<br><br><i>January 2<br>There's no place like home</i><br><br>Some families are on their best behavior when they go out but like to kick back at home. They also let this philosophy govern their manners. Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York, once told a reporter about her formula for good manners at the table. She and her daughters have A, B, and C manners, she explained. When they're dining with the queen at Buckingham Palace, they use their very best A manners. When they're at a restaurant, they're more relaxed, so they use their B manners. And at home? They're even less proper; C manners are fine.<br><br>Contrast Fergie's philosophy with pre-Civil War Eliza Farrar's. "Would it not be more refined and honest," she wrote in The Young Ladies Friend (1834), "to live a little better every day and make less a parade before company?"<br><br>There may be some value in being relaxed at home, but at what cost? One of your goals as a parent is for good manners to become habits for your child. If chewing with his mouth closed is necessary when he's out but not when he's at home, chances are he won't chew properly at home or when he's out. Having different codes of manners can be confusing to your child and not very practical in the long run. It's a bit like telling a pianist that how he plays at home doesn't matter as long as he performs well at a recital.<br><br>Parents can save themselves some headaches and teach children that the family deserves to see their best behavior. Here are a few ways parents can encourage children to help make home a nice place to be. Suggest that they:<br><br>1. Talk to their parents. Say "good morning" and "good night."<br><br>2. Respect the privacy of others. Don't listen in on phone conversations, read others' mail, or snoop in their closets.<br><br>3. Knock gently on a closed door before entering.<br><br>4. Use good table manners.<br><br>5. Borrow items only if they've asked to do so. Return them in good condition.<br><br>6. Spend time with their siblings. Don't hibernate in the bedroom.<br><br>7. Ask family members how things are going.<br><br>8. Use an "indoor voice" when they're in the house.<br><br>9. Pick up after themselves.<br><br>10. Don't let their goodbyes be accompanied by unkind words.<br><br><b>Activity</b><br><br>Post the above list on your refrigerator and compliment your child when he puts one of the rules into practice. If your child likes to create things on the computer, have him design the list for the fridge.<br><br><i>January 3<br>"Please," "thank you," and "I'm sorry"</i><br><br>Sometimes a child's good manners reveal a naturally sunny, kind disposition. This isn't always the case, but practicing good manners helps a child begin to develop consideration for others.<br><br>By following good manners in daily life, we learn to control ourselves and become aware of how our actions and words affect others. At some point, with enough practice, the learned formalities become second nature.<br><br>This is certainly the case with saying "please," "thank you," and "I'm sorry."<br><br>As soon as a child is able to extend a chubby little hand and ask for a cookie, you should encourage him to say "please." As soon as he is old enough to be given a gift, prompt him to say "thank you." As soon as he can offend another person, "I'm sorry" should become part of his vocabulary. Your child may still believe he's the center of the universe, but his words should reveal a person who cares for other's feelings.<br><br>"Please" should be part of every request. Insist that your child say, "May I please have a drink?" If the child is very young, "Drink, please" is okay.<br><br>"Thank you" should always acknowledge receipt of an item, favor, or kindness. Children should use it when they are handed a cookie, when they've been given a gift, or when they've visited someone's home.<br><br>"I'm sorry" (not "I didn't mean to!"): These two words can calm rough tempers, smooth hurt feelings, and give everyone a fresh start. Children should say this when they break something, make another child cry, or forget to do a chore, for example.<br><br><b>Activity<br></b>Use the prompt-and-praise method for reinforcing the use of the kind words in this lesson. Prompt your child in private about when to say "please" and "thank you." Praise him in private after he puts your suggestions into action. Also, always say "I'm sorry" to your child when you're wrong about something.<br><br><i>January 4<br>Apologizing</i><br><br>Children should be encouraged to make "please" and "thank you" a daily part of their vocabulary. But two other small but powerful words belong there, too: "I'm sorry."<br><br>When a child inadvertently bumps into another child in the hall at school, "I'm sorry" is the right thing to say. When she realizes she's taken a second brownie before someone else has had a first, "I'm sorry" helps her appear polite. When your child is late, forgets to bring her uniform, or lets her pet dig in the neighbor's garden, "I'm sorry" shows she can take responsibility for her actions. Little offenses stay little when they are acknowledged and apologized for. When nothing is said, they could ruin a friendship.<br><br>At times an apology needs to be written. Your child doesn't need to apologize in writing for small offenses if she's had a chance to apologize verbally, and she shouldn't apologize too much or if she's done nothing wrong.<br><br>But if your child breaks something or betrays a friend by revealing a secret, a short note of apology can accompany the replacement of the broken item or a bag of candy for the wounded friend. A note of apology might look like this:<br><br><i>Dear Alicia,<br><br>I am so sorry I told Kelsie that you're getting glasses. You told me to keep it a secret and I went and blabbed it anyway. I know you're worried about what it will be like and I only made matters worse. Please forgive me. You're my best friend and I feel terrible that I hurt your feelings.<br><br>Jenna</i><br><br>Activity<br><br>Tell your child about a time that you apologized to someone. Explain how you felt and how things worked out.</p><h2>A Place of Quiet Rest: Finding Intimacy with God Through a Daily Devotional Life</h2><p><p>The God of the universe created us for a love relationship with Him!&nbsp; We long for that sweet intimacy with God, but it often seems so out of reach.&nbsp; Yet even in the busyness of&nbsp;daily life, we hear those whispers calling us, drawing us to sit at the feet of Jesus.<br><br>Best-selling author&nbsp;Nancy Leigh DeMoss demystifies the process of coming to know God intimately.&nbsp; For over 10 years <i>A Place of Quiet Rest</i> has spoken to readers, helping them to a deeper relationship with Christ.

The authors touch all the bases--they address new trends in international movie making, technologies, and critical theory and the emergence of new national and ethnic cinemas--and relate film history to social history. Each new technique, style, school, trend, and newly visible ethnic or feminist group takes its place in the larger history, and Dixon and Foster make it all accessible to the neophyte reader without ever breaking the pace. Uncommonly well-reproduced stills and a topically organized bibliography enhance the discussion. Highly recommended." --<i>Choice</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"This excellent introduction stands out in a crowded field with its lively, accessible writing, broad coverage, and particular focus on traditionally marginalized figures in film history...the most striking aspect of the book is the coverage of women, African Americans, and Third World filmmakers, which strongly complements its solid coverage of American and European film.

It offers not only thoroughness and concision, but also encourages meaningful browsing, as readers can pick and choose their topics of particular interest and then move on as desired." - Catherine Ritchie, <i>Dallas Public Library</i><br><br> "Dixon and Foster's <i>A Short History of Film</i> provides an excellent starting point into the study of film history.&nbsp; It is organized chronologically beginning with the inventions which allowed for film's creation like the Kinetoscope, the Cinematograph, and the magic lantern in the silent era, leading into the inventions of the era of sound, and finally ending with the computer-generated films of the contemporary world.&nbsp; <br><br>Important events such as World War II and the Cold War, which greatly influenced the production and consumption of films, are given their own chapters or sections.&nbsp; Furthermore, the significant eras of film history, according to film and cinema scholars, comprising French New Wave, Italian neo-realism, the Hollywood studio-system of the 1930s and 1940s, and worldwide independent film endeavors are incorporated.

It is compiled in a way that allows distance learning, with explicit solutions to set problems freely available online. The miscellaneous exercises at the end of each chapter comprise questions from past exam papers from various universities, helping to reinforce the reader's confidence. Also included, generally at the beginning of sections, are short historical biographies of the leading players in the field of linear algebra to provide context for the topics covered. <br><br>The dynamic and engaging style of the book includes frequent question and answer sections to test the reader's understanding of the methods introduced, rather than requiring rote learning. When first encountered, the subject can appear abstract and students will sometimes struggle to see its relevance; to counter this, the book also contains interviews with key people who use linear algebra in practice, in both professional and academic life. It will appeal to undergraduate students in mathematics, the physical sciences and engineering.<br></p><p>Why purchase this book?In this age of data explosion, linear algebra has become the most powerful tool in the entire field of mathematics.

We see our arms and legs move, but may have no idea how the muscles beneath look as they contract. We know that our stomachs digest food and our hearts pump blood, but the images we have in our heads of these organs are often inaccurate or incomplete. Even seeing pictures of our internal systems and organs can be misleading if these pictures don't offer a full, 360-degree view. This new flexibound edition of <i>Anatomy 360</i> shows the human body in its entirety&#x2014;from the skin to the muscles to the organs to the bones. This stunning book provides a unique perspective on our most crucial parts, showing how the structures of our bodies influence their functions. You'll learn about the vagus nerve, which allows us to swallow, speak, and cough, and the frontalis muscle, which raises our eyebrows when we're surprised. You'll also learn why our noses run when we cry and why our brains are so important even though they weigh just one kilogram each. With <i>Anatomy 360</i>, you'll finally get a complete look at the human body&#x2014;even the parts you thought you'd never see!<br><br><b>The hardcover edition of <i>Anatomy 360</i> won the Gold Award in Reference from <i>ForeWord</i>&#x2019;s 2011 Book of the Year Awards</b><br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Dr. Jamie Roebuck</b> is a lecturer in anatomy and physiology in the Clinical Education Department at the University of Warwick, England.</p><h2>4S03 - Royal Conservatory Four Star Sight Reading and Ear Tests Level 3 Book 2015 Edition</h2><p>This graded series of eleven books, covering beginner to advanced levels, develops comprehensive reading ability and musical understanding.

The perfect gift for little Hobbits everywhere!&nbsp;Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.<br><br></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><b>Scenes from <em>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies</em></b></p> <em> </em> Luke Evans as Bard and Orlando Bloom as Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, in theatres December 17, 2014.

As three generations of Kelleher women arrive at the family's beach house, each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant, waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep, never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the events of one night, long ago.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Laura Dave on <em>Maine</em></strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Laura Dave</strong> is the author of the acclaimed novels </em> The Divorce Party, London Is the Best City in America <em>, and </em> The First Husband <em>.

Would her story of three generations of Kelleher women who find themselves back at their summer home--all facing their own secret hardships and challenges--deliver? It certainly did.</p> <p>It is the final summer in Maine for the Kelleher family, and its four strong-willed women are dreaming of bare feet, cocktails at sunset, and that magical ocean air. Alice is the matriarch, a regular fixture at morning mass, and an equally regular fixture in the wicker chair on the sun porch where she spends all afternoon drinking manhattans and smoking cigarettes. Maggie is Alice&#x2019;s granddaughter, a thirty-two-year-old writer who has just realized she's pregnant, a fact she has yet to tell her off-again boyfriend. Maggie&#x2019;s mother, Kathleen, is the prodigal daughter, camped out in California, wishing desperately to avoid the annual Kelleher showdown. And Ann Marie, Alice&#x2019;s daughter-in-law, is the long-suffering martyr and avid dollhouse collector who is determined to keep this chaotic household in order.</p> <p>Over the course of this summer, long-held secrets are revealed, embarrassing crushes bloom, and gallons of vodka are consumed. While Alice must face reminders of a devastating tragedy, Maggie has to decide what to do about Gabe and the baby, Kathleen comes face to face with the woman she most fears, and Ann Marie desperately tries to maintain the image of a perfect family.</p> <p>Sullivan spins an unhurried and thoughtful tale that delves into familial love, romantic heartaches, tightly-held longings, and a lot of hope.

She shut the radio off and rolled down the window. Ruby and Jane both hustled out the front door, Ruby in the white fringe dress and Jane in a mask of disbelief. <br><br>&#x201c;Are you kidding me with this?&#x201d; Jane said, poking her head into the passenger-side window. <br><br>&#x201c;Mom, God, it&#x2019;s just a dress,&#x201d; Ruby said, slumping into the backseat. &#x201c;That is definitely not an entire dress.&#x201d; Jane let herself collapse into the seat, her heavy body rocking the small car as she pulled the door shut and buckled her seat belt. She spoke without turning to face Zoe. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you agreed to let her wear that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m right here, you know,&#x201d; Ruby said. <br><br>Jane kept staring straight ahead. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just go. I can&#x2019;t even.&#x201d; <br><br>Zoe put the car in reverse. She caught Ruby&#x2019;s eye in the rearview mirror. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so excited for you, sweetie.&#x201d; <br><br>Ruby rolled her eyes. It was an involuntary gesture, like breathing, an automatic response to whatever her mothers said. &#x201c;I can tell,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You could always just drop me off with Chloe&#x2019;s family, they&#x2019;re going to the River Caf� for dinner.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;The River Caf� isn&#x2019;t what it used to be,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;Those stupid Brooklyn Bridge chocolate cakes. It&#x2019;s for tourists.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Ruby said, and turned to look out the window. <br><br>When they got to the school, Jane hopped out and switched places with Zoe&#x2014;someone was going to have to circle the block to find a parking spot, and they both knew that Ruby would have a meltdown if she had to drive past her school three hundred times before going inside. All the seniors and their families were milling around in front and in the lobby, everyone dressed like they were going to the prom. Whitman didn&#x2019;t have a prom, of course&#x2014;that was too square, too suburban. Instead they had a party with the entire faculty in a converted loft space in Dumbo. Zoe was waiting for the e-mail to go out that the students and teachers had been caught having a group orgy in the bathroom. Most of the teachers looked like they could have been students, maybe held back a couple of grades. The young men almost always grew scruffy little beards or goatees, probably just to prove that they could. Ruby had skipped the party, &#x201c;Because eww,&#x201d; which Zoe secretly agreed with. <br><br>Zoe let Ruby lead her through the crowd in front of the school, weaving in and out. She nodded and waved to the parents she knew, and squeezed the arms of some of the kids. It was a small school, and Ruby had gone there since she was five, and so Zoe knew everyone, whether or not Ruby deigned to speak to them. Ruby&#x2019;s intermittently loving and cruel cluster of girlfriends&#x2014;Chloe, Paloma, Anika, and Sarah&#x2014;were already inside, posing for pictures with their parents and siblings, and Zoe knew that Ruby was likely to ditch her and Jane for her friends as soon as possible. Impending-graduation hormones made regular puberty hormones seem like nothing&#x2014;Ruby had been a lunatic for months. They went inside through the heavy front door, and Zoe saw Elizabeth and Harry across the lobby. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, wait,&#x201d; she said to Ruby, pointing. Ruby reluctantly slowed to a stop and crossed her arms over her chest. <br><br>&#x201c;Ruby! Congratulations, sweetheart!&#x201d; Elizabeth, bless her, couldn&#x2019;t be stymied by Ruby&#x2019;s death stares. &#x201c;That dress looks phenomenal on you. Yowza!&#x201d; Zoe watched her daughter soften. She even managed to squeeze out a tiny smile. <br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Ruby said. &#x201c;I mean, it&#x2019;s just high school. It&#x2019;s really not that big of a deal. It&#x2019;s really only a big deal if you don&#x2019;t graduate from high school, you know what I mean? Like, I also learned how to walk and to use a fork.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry chuckled. &#x201c;I can tie my shoes,&#x201d; he said. He kicked his toe into the floor for emphasis, and also to avoid looking Ruby in the eye. Even though Harry and Ruby had grown up together, had lived three houses apart for most of their lives, things had changed in the last few years. When they were children, they&#x2019;d played together, taken baths together, built forts and choreographed dances. Now Harry could barely speak in front of her. Mostly, when he was standing next to Ruby, all Harry could think about was a photograph that his mother had on her dresser of him and Ruby when he was one and she was two, both of them standing naked in the front yard. His penis looked so tiny, like the stubbiest baby carrot in the bag, the one you might not even eat because you were afraid it was actually a toe. <br><br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Ruby scanned the room, looking over Harry&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Oh, shit,&#x201d; she said. Zoe, Elizabeth, and Harry all turned to follow her gaze. &#x201c;Mum, stay here.&#x201d; She hustled across the room, elbowing people out of her way. <br><br>Zoe craned her neck&#x2014;the room was getting more and more crowded. &#x201c;Who is she talking to, Harr?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dust,&#x201d; Harry said, and immediately regretted it. He&#x2019;d seen them kissing in front of school, and on their street after dark, standing in between parked cars. Dust was obviously not the kind of boy a girl would bring home to her parents, even if her parents were cool, like Ruby&#x2019;s. There would be too many questions. Dust was the kind of guy, if life had been a sitcom, that Ruby&#x2019;s moms would have tried to adopt, because it turned out he couldn&#x2019;t read and had been living on a park bench since he was twelve. But in real life, Dust was just kind of scary, and Ruby should have known better. Harry had lots of good ideas about who she should go out with instead, and they were all him. <br><br>&#x201c;Dust?&#x201d; Elizabeth asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Is that a name? Does he go to school here? How old is he?&#x201d; Zoe said. <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Harry said, waving his hand by his ear. It was getting loud in the school&#x2019;s lobby, and he was sweating. It was better to pretend he hadn&#x2019;t heard. Ruby was going to be so mad at him. Harry felt a deep, sudden longing for the indifference she&#x2019;d shown him since the ninth grade. <br>The head of the high school came out and shouted for the seniors to get lined up, and the crowd began to disperse. Excited parents took photos of each other with their phones, and a few with real cameras. Teachers wore ties and shook hands. Elizabeth cupped Harry&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s fine. Should we go get seats? Zo, you want me to save you and Jane spots?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hang on,&#x201d; Zoe said. Now that people were filing into the auditorium, it was a straight shot through the lobby to the door, where Ruby was having an argument with the boy, who looked like a skinhead. Were there still skinheads? He was taller than Ruby and was stooped over to talk to her, his shoulders rounding like an old man&#x2019;s. Ruby looked furious, and the boy did, too. His face was pointy and sharp, and his chin jutted out toward her daughter&#x2019;s sweet face. &#x201c;Harry, spill it.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry felt his face begin to burn. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s her boyfriend.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is his name Dust or Shit?&#x201d; Elizabeth asked. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the story?&#x201d; Chloe and Paloma were inching across the room toward Ruby, teetering on their new heels like baby dinosaurs. <br><br>Harry opened his mouth to answer&#x2014;he&#x2019;d never been good at lying&#x2014;but just then Ruby let out a little scream, and before he could think about what he was doing, Harry was running across the room. He threw his entire body at Dust, and the two of them hit the floor with a thud. Harry felt Dust roll away and then saw him scurry up and out the door like a hermit crab, on his hands and feet. Ruby stood over Harry with her own hands on her mouth. For a second she looked actually frightened, and the dangly white tassels of her dress shook a tiny bit, almost like she was dancing. It was the most beautiful dress Harry had ever seen. It wasn&#x2019;t just a dress; it was a religion. It was an erupting volcano that would kill hundreds of pale-faced tourists, and Harry was ready for the lava to flow. Ruby regained her composure and looked around the room. A half circle had formed around them, and their mothers were cutting through it, mouths open like hungry guppies. Ruby turned toward the crowd, smiled, and did a pageant winner wave, her elbow gliding back and forth. Both Chloe and Paloma made mewling noises and reached for her with grasping fingers, but Ruby ignored them. &#x201c;My hero,&#x201d; she said archly to Harry, and extended her hand to help him up from the floor.</p><h2>The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasons and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus</h2><p><b><i>The Hiram Key</i></b> is a book that will shake the Christian world to its very roots. When Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas, both Masons, set out to find the origins of Freemasonry they had no idea that they would find themselves unraveling the true story of Jesus and the original Jerusalem Church. As a radically new picture of Jesus started to emerge, the authors came to the startling conclusion that the key rituals of modern Freemasonry were practiced by the early followers of Jesus as a means of initiation into their community.</p><p>Robert Lomas is the co-author of <i>The Hiram Key</i>, <i>The Second Messiah</i>, and <i>Uriel's Machine</i>. A Freemason, he lectures at Bradford University in England.Introduction: <p>Henry Ford once declared that &#x2018;all history is bunk&#x2019;. It may have sounded a little abrupt but when it comes to the &#x2018;facts&#x2019; of the past which most Westerners are taught in school, it turns out that Mr. Ford was right. </p><p>Our starting point was a private piece of research to find the origins of Freemasonry &#x2014; the world&#x2019;s largest society that today has almost five million male members in regular Lodges and has in the past included many great men amongst its number, from Mozart to Henry Ford. As Freemasons, our goal was to try to understand a little about the meaning of Masonic ritual: those strange, secret ceremonies carried out by mainly middle-class, middle-aged men from Huddersfield to Houston. </p><p>At the center of Masonic lore is a character called Hiram Abif who, according to a story told to every Freemason, was murdered almost three thousand years ago at the building of King Solomon&#x2019;s Temple. This man is a total enigma. His role as the builder of King Solomon&#x2019;s Temple and the circumstances of his horrible death are clearly described in Masonic history, yet he is not mentioned in the Old Testament. For four of the six years we spent working on this research, we believed that Hiram Abif was a symbolic creation. But then he materialized out of the mists of time to prove himself very real indeed. </p><p>Once Hiram Abif emerged from the distant past, he provided nothing less than a new key to Western history. The intellectual contortions and labored conclusions that have previously formed Western society&#x2019;s collective view of the past gave way to simple and logical order. Our researches led us first to reconstructing the ancient Egyptian kingmaking ritual of four thousand years ago; that in turn led us to uncover an assassination that took place around 1570 BC, which gave rise to a resurrection ceremony that is the direct antecedent of modern Freemasonry. As we tracked the development of this secret ritual from Thebes to Jerusalem, we uncovered its role in the building of the Hebrew nation and in the evolution of Jewish theology. </p><p>In startling contrast to what is currently held to be fact, the Western world actually developed according to a very ancient philosophy encoded into a secret system that has come to the surface at three key moments over the last three thousand years. </p><p>The final proof of our findings may well turn out to be the archaeological find of the century. We have located the secret scrolls of Jesus and his followers.</p></p><h2>Uproar: Calm Leadership in Anxious Times</h2><p>If &#x201c;these are the times that test men&#x2019;s souls,&#x201d; never more than for the leader&#x2019;s ability to think clearly, to be present calmly, and to challenge effectively. It&#x2019;s a time when leaders cannot be as anxious as those they serve; otherwise, the system is leaderless. Anxiety flows down like water from a leaky pipe. To lead effectively we must understand the impact of powerful emotional forces on people&#x2019;s behavior, especially in anxious times.<br><br>Uproar: Calm Leadership in Anxious Times helps leaders understand the powerful impact that emotional processes have on the people they lead. Peter Steinke, bestselling author of CongregationalLeadership in Anxious Times draws on decades of work on system conflict and personal experiences to share real stories of challenges leaders have faced and how understanding the power of emotions has dramatically influenced their success. In this book, readers will observe important leadership characteristics such as separating oneself from the surrounding anxiety, making decisions based on principle and not instinct, taking responsibility for one&#x2019;s own emotional being, staying connected to others including those who disagree with you, being a non-anxious presence, focusing on emotional processes rather than the symptoms they produce, knowing people naturally influence one another, and recognizing leader and follower as complements. At the end of each chapter, there is a Leader&#x2019;s Notebook, a short section to illustrate, enrich or engage your thinking about leadership. As Steinke suggests, being anxious causes you to lose perspective, and leaders do their best thinking when they are not overly stressed and can think about options, doing their best work when they work on themselves. So where are you in your leadership journey? No matter where you are&#x2014;beginning, middle or end&#x2014; this book will be one the most significant leadership books you&#x2019;ll read.</p><p>Peter L. Steinke is an internationally recognized leadership consultant who has served as a parish pastor, therapist, director of a counseling center, educator, and executive director of Healthy Congregations. He is the author of several books, including Congregational Leadership in Anxious Times: Being Calm and Courageous No Matter What.[Steinke] explores the impact and responsibilities of business leaders during tumultuous times in this distinctive study. He touts psychiatrist Murray Bowen&#x2019;s theory, based on research into parent-child dynamics, that the strength of &#x201c;systems&#x201d; such as families and companies depends primarily on the emotional health of those in charge. Steinke argues that, thanks to a plethora of causes including &#x201c;recession, two wars, worries about jobs,&#x201d; and simply &#x201c;sheer massive change,&#x201d; the U.S. is in a state he dubs &#x201c;Uproar,&#x201d; a time of widespread confusion and dislocation. At such times, how leaders deal with anxiety&#x2014;their own and others&#x2014;will make all the difference. As a contrast to effective leadership, Steinke discusses the &#x201c;lizard brain,&#x201d; the instinctual level of the human mind, which reacts to perceived threats automatically, not reflectively. To counter this tendency, Steinke shows how leaders can adopt a &#x201c;non-anxious presence&#x201d; and stay on guard for major anxiety triggers, namely &#x201c;disruptions,&#x201d; &#x201c;feeling trapped,&#x201d; &#x201c;threat,&#x201d; &#x201c;differences,&#x201d; &#x201c;uncertainty,&#x201d; and &#x201c;depletion.&#x201d; Steinke includes numerous examples, such as of a newly appointed CEO who pacified feuding departments by creating a workers&#x2019; bonus pool. Readers in leadership and support roles alike will find much to ponder and draw on as they struggle to maintain balance and keep their composure at times of stress at work., <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>Peter Steinke is a clear-eyed, skilled consultant whose insights have stood the test of time.

But religious freedom in America is, in fact, impossible. So argues this timely and iconoclastic work by law and religion scholar Winnifred Sullivan. Sullivan uses as the backdrop for the book the trial of Warner vs. Boca Raton, a recent case concerning the laws that protect the free exercise of religion in America. The trial, for which the author served as an expert witness, concerned regulations banning certain memorials from a multiconfessional nondenominational cemetery in Boca Raton, Florida. The book portrays the unsuccessful struggle of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish families in Boca Raton to preserve the practice of placing such religious artifacts as crosses and stars of David on the graves of the city-owned burial ground.</p><br><p> Sullivan demonstrates how, during the course of the proceeding, citizens from all walks of life and religious backgrounds were harassed to define just what their religion is. She argues that their plight points up a shocking truth: religion cannot be coherently defined for the purposes of American law, because everyone has different definitions of what religion is. Indeed, while religious freedom as a political idea was arguably once a force for tolerance, it has now become a force for intolerance, she maintains.</p><br><p> A clear-eyed look at the laws created to protect religious freedom, this vigorously argued book offers a new take on a right deemed by many to be necessary for a free democratic society. It will have broad appeal not only for religion scholars, but also for anyone interested in law and the Constitution.</p></p><p><p>"This is a remarkably fine work that discusses the way religion is perceived and dealt with in the United States. The subject is of great moment not only in America but also in the world at large, and Sullivan has treated it with considerable analytical skill and ethnographic detail. The result is a powerful and convincing argument."<b>--Talal Asad, City University of New York Graduate Center</b></p><p>"Provocative. Engaging. Valuable. Sullivan has created a kind of analytical triptych that captures some of the most important features of religions and law in the United States. It is a finely crafted portrait of an incredibly suggestive trial, a meditation on the political/legal status of folk religions in the United States, and a theoretical intervention into contemporary studies of religion jurisprudence."<b>--Jason Bivins, North Carolina State University.</b></p><p>"<i>The Impossibility of Religious Freedom</i> is an astonishing book. Winnifred Sullivan once again demonstrates her flair for extracting a big lesson from a seemingly small event--in this book, a controversy over the allowable style of grave markers in a public cemetery in Boca Raton, Florida. To the town, the issue was the ease of mowing the cemetery and making it look tidy; for the survivors of the dead buried in the cemetery the issue was the appropriate expression of religious faith. This case looks like a simple church-state controversy, but Sullivan (an expert witness in the case) deftly explains why the federal court and the First Amendment really cannot cope with the issues involved. Separating church and state requires defining what religion is. The devil here is in the definition. Sullivan offers an important challenge to the easy assumptions to the current propensity of federal courts to accommodate religion. What is religion anyway? Read this fascinating story to see how challenging that question is."<b>--Stanley N. Katz, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Sullivan's exploration of unofficial religion is elegant, moving, uncompromising, and profoundly important. By examining religion literally from the ground up, it challenges all of the familiar pieties about religious liberty in America."<b>--Philip Hamburger, author of <i>Separation of Church and State</i></b></p><b>Winnifred Fallers Sullivan</b> is associate professor of law and director of the Law and Religion Program at the University at Buffalo Law School. She is also the author of <i>Paying the Words Extra: Religious Discourse in the Supreme Court of the United States</i>.</p><h2>A Larger Hope?, Volume 1: Universal Salvation from Christian Beginnings to Julian of Norwich</h2><p>In the minds of some, universal salvation is a heretical idea that was imported into Christianity from pagan philosophies by Origen (c.185&#x2013;253/4). Ilaria Ramelli argues that this picture is completely mistaken. She maintains that Christian theologians were the <i>first</i> people to proclaim that all will be saved and that their reasons for doing so were rooted in their faith in Christ. She demonstrates that, in fact, the idea of the final restoration of all creation (<i>apokatastasis</i>) was grounded upon the teachings of the Bible and the church&#x2019;s beliefs about Jesus&#x2019; total triumph over sin, death, and evil through his incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. <br> Ramelli traces the Christian roots of Origen&#x2019;s teaching on <i>apokatastasis</i>. She argues that he was drawing on texts from Scripture and from various Christians who preceded him, theologians such as Bardaisan, Irenaeus, and Clement. She outlines Origen&#x2019;s often-misunderstood theology in some detail and then follows the legacy of his Christian universalism through the centuries that followed. We are treated to explorations of Origenian universal salvation in a host of Christian disciples, including Athanasius, Didymus the Blind, the Cappadocian fathers, Evagrius, Maximus the Confessor, John Scotus Eriugena, and Julian of Norwich.</p><p>wipfandstock.com/a-larger-hope-volume-1.htmlwipfandstock.com/author/view/detail/id/12682/Ilaria L.

He must have known that donning <i>the</i> rival jersey was bound to get a rise out of the other students. He arrogantly strutted around my class, taunting the other players that he was going to take their places on the field, then leisurely strolled to the back of the classroom and took a seat. <br><br>As I started to discuss the curriculum, my students rocked in their seats and played percussion with their pencils. Some checked their pagers, while others reapplied their eyeliner. Some slouched, some laid their heads on the desks, and some actually took a nap. This was not the reception I was hoping for on my first day as a student teacher. <br><br>I dodged a paper airplane&#x2014;made out of my syllabus, I quickly realized&#x2014;and tried to make myself heard over a string of &#x201c;yo mama&#x201d; jokes. <br><br>I fidgeted with my pearls. I glanced at the polka-dot dress I was wearing&#x2014;it was similar to the one that Julia Roberts wore in <i>Pretty Woman</i>&#x2014;and wondered if I had chosen the wrong profession.<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t I gone to law school like I&#x2019;d originally planned? In a courtroom, unlike this chaotic classroom, a judge would bang his gavel with gusto after the first projectile had flown across the room, and any innuendo about his mother&#x2019;s integrity would bring instant charges of contempt of court. I needed a daunting authority figure in a black robe to tell these kids that they were &#x201c;out of order.&#x201d; I looked around the room, but an authority figure was nowhere to be found. Then came a panicked realization&#x2014;I was the authority figure, armed only with a broken piece of chalk.<br><br>As a student teacher, I should have been able to rely on my supervising teacher, but he had stepped out of the classroom. When I met with him over the summer, he suggested that it would be a good idea for me to begin teaching on the first day of school, rather than easing my way into it. &#x201c;If you dive right in,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll establish your authority from the get&#x2013;go.&#x201d; From the comfort of his living room, this suggestion sounded great. I had visions of passing out my syllabus and having students stick out their hands like Oliver Twist and ask for &#x201c;more.&#x201d; In reality, the only person requesting &#x201c;more&#x201d; was my supervising teacher, who conveniently snuck out to get &#x201c;more&#x201d; coffee and never returned.<br><br>After nearly forty years of teaching, my supervising teacher planned to retire at the end of the school year. He had emotionally checked out and was now simply coasting on autopilot. I&#x2019;d assumed student teachers were to be handled like timid student drivers, with someone ready to grab the wheel when changing lanes or parallel parking went awry. Since my so&#x2013;called mentor wasn&#x2019;t there to put on the brakes or take control, I didn&#x2019;t know which direction to go except forward.<br><br>To gain my composure, I tried to sound authoritative while reading my supervising teacher&#x2019;s &#x201c;Guidelines for Student Behavior.&#x201d; I heard some students snickering. I stopped reading to see what they were laughing about. <br><br>&#x201c;You got chalk on your ass,&#x201d; yelled a student from the back. <br><br>&#x201c;Daaamn, girl! Can I have some fries with that shake?&#x201d; said another. <br><br>Somehow the &#x201c;Guidelines&#x201d; weren&#x2019;t sticking, because the class was completely out of control. Even though I had studied classroom management, it was obvious that my students were the ones managing me. I just wanted to make it to the end of the hour.<br><br>Right before the bell rang, one of my students, Melvin, leaned back in his seat and announced, &#x201c;I give her five days!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on,&#x201d; said Manny.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna make this lady cry in front of the whole class,&#x201d; Sharaud bragged as he walked out the door.<br><br>At that moment, I could hear my father&#x2019;s smug &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; echo in my mind. A little less foreboding than &#x201c;Beware the Ides of March,&#x201d; but accurate nevertheless.<br><br>I felt like a failure. It was obvious that I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing. I had no idea how to engage these apathetic teenagers who hated reading, hated writing, and apparently hated me. And to make matters worse, student teachers did not receive salaries&#x2014;we actually paid for the privilege! I was holding down two part&#x2013;time jobs after school and on weekends to help pay for my semester&#x2019;s tuition at the university. I worked at Nordstrom department store as a salesclerk in the lingerie department and at a Marriott Hotel as a concierge. Paying to teach in the trenches was like putting my face through a cutout hole at a carnival while a quarterback threw pies at me. At least with a carnival, I&#x2019;d see it coming.<br><br>Once the students left, I picked up the paper airplane off the floor. I circled the room, collecting handouts that had been left behind, and saw ESL scribbled in black marker on several desks on the left side of the room. In educational jargon, ESL stands for English as a Second Language. Earlier, when I&#x2019;d seen <i>ESL</i> etched on my door, I&#x2019;d foolishly thought some Spanish-speaker was paying homage to my classroom. I soon realized this ESL had nothing to do with education&#x2014;it was the acronym for East Side Longos&#x2014;the largest Latino gang in Long Beach.<br><br>Similar gang insignias were on other desks. These defaced desks marked my students&#x2019; territory. The Asian students hit up the desks with the name of their respective gang affiliation, as did the African Americans. My multicultural classes in college had conveniently left out the chapter on gangs and turf warfare.<br><br>In lieu of a seating chart, I naively let the students pick their own seats. What struck me now was that they chose comfort zones determined by race. This realization gave me pause. I had imagined my students filing into my class and forming a melting pot of colors as they chose their seats, but the pot must have been pretty cold, because there was absolutely no melting. The Latinos had staked out the left side, while the Asian students occupied the right. The back row was occupied by all the African American students, and a couple of Caucasians sheepishly huddled together in the front.<br><br>My classroom wasn&#x2019;t the only place where the students segregated themselves. It was worse out on the school quad. During lunch, the students again separated themselves based on racial identity. The students even had nicknamed their distinct areas: &#x201c;Beverly Hills 90210,&#x201d; &#x201c;Chinatown&#x201d; (even though most of the students were immigrants from Cambodia), the &#x201c;Ghetto,&#x201d; and &#x201c;South of the Border.&#x201d;<br><br>The transparent segregation of the school shocked me, especially since I was expecting Wilson to be a model of integration. On paper, it was one of the most culturally diverse schools in the country, and I&#x2019;d chosen to studentteach at Wilson for exactly that reason. Clearly, there was a disparity between what I&#x2019;d read about Wilson High and its reality. <br><br>My dad used to share stories about seeing segregation firsthand. In the early sixties, when he was drafted to play minor league baseball for the Washington Senators, some of his teammates were forced to drink out of separate fountains, eat at different sections in restaurants, and stay at separate motels whenever his team traveled through the South. As a catcher, my dad said &#x201c;he judged a batter by his swing, not the color of his skin.&#x201d; So when Hank Aaron started hitting balls out of the park, my father hailed him as his new hero and named his daughter Erin in honor of the legendary batter.<br><br>I was fascinated by my namesake for challenging the status quo and thus helping to change the face of America&#x2019;s favorite pastime. I hoped Hammerin&#x2019; Hank&#x2019;s influence would make its way out of the stadiums and into the classrooms. Disappointingly, it didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>After lunch, all the kids from the &#x201c;Beverly Hills 90210&#x201d; section trotted to class together. Among them were students whose apparel and matching school sweatshirts identified them as water polo players, cheerleaders, and student council members. Their classrooms had banners that read &#x201c;Home of the Distinguished Scholars,&#x201d; along with freshly published textbooks and new computers. In contrast, my room was pretty barren. It didn&#x2019;t have any banners, much less a computer. All I had to work with were hand&#x2013;me&#x2013;down textbooks riddled with graffiti. <br><br>In the Distinguished Scholars classrooms, the desks were neatly lined up and filled primarily with Caucasians. Nestled between the rows may have been an occasional African American or Asian student, but it was clear that a tracking system was in place.<br><br>The few Caucasians in my class were stigmatized as outcasts by their friends in the Distinguished Scholars program. The general assumption was that they had failed out of the Distinguished Scholars program, had a learning disability, or had just returned from rehab. By the look of things, some were probably on their way back in.<br><br>There was a perception in the affluent neighborhood south of the school that the caliber of students attending Wilson had plummeted in recent years. At one point, Wilson High was considered a highly desirable public high school, but there had been noticeable &#x201c;white flight&#x201d; after the school district implemented an intradistrict busing program. By the early nineties, the Caucasian population had decreased to less than twenty-five percent. Some speculated that the Distinguished Scholars program was an attempt to rescue the school&#x2019;s declining reputation and keep neighborhood kids from transferring out. My hope was that I could find something &#x201c;distinguished&#x201d; in all of my students.<br><br>At the end of my first day, the security guard popped his head into my class. Earlier that morning, he had stopped me in the hallway. He had a walkie-talkie in one hand and a metal-detector wand in the other. &#x201c;We have zero tolerance for weapons on campus,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d warned me. Then he asked to see my ID. I handed him my student ID card from the university. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a student teacher,&#x201d; I stammered. &#x201c;I will be teaching junior English.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said with a shrug, &#x201c;you look like one of the students.&#x201d; <br><br>Now the security guard was here to tell me, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a police officer looking for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Did somebody steal my car?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he laughed, &#x201c;he said he knows you.&#x201d;<br><br>I went to the office and was surprised to see my old neighbor, Mark, in full police uniform. <br><br>&#x201c;Mark, what are you doing here?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Your brother asked me to check up on you,&#x201d; he said. Mark had been checking up on me since I was seven. He even threatened to beat up neighborhood boys with his nunchucks simply for flirting with me when we were in the sixth grade.<br><br>Mark and I had grown up in the same gated community, but I always suspected that he wanted to keep people out of those gates, whereas I wanted to bring them in. Our paths diverged after high school. I went on to college, and Mark entered the police academy. Coincidentally, we both ended up in Long Beach. It was obvious that Mark had not come to Long Beach out of moral obligation. He came to Long Beach because that&#x2019;s where the action was.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any bullet holes, so I assume you survived your first day,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Barely!&#x201d; I laughed. &#x201c;My family&#x2019;s a little paranoid,&#x201d; I offered. &#x201c;My father called me this morning and said, &#x2018;Erin, no matter what you do, please don&#x2019;t eat the apples!&#x2019; He&#x2019;s convinced they&#x2019;re laced with strychnine or razor blades.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably right!&#x201d; he said, and chuckled.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It&#x2019;s not that bad!&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me it&#x2019;s not that bad. I&#x2019;m a cop, remember? I&#x2019;m the one arresting these kids. There are parts of Long Beach that are like a war zone. Especially after the Rodney King riots. There have been about a hundred gang&#x2013;related murders in Long Beach already this year.&#x201d;<br><br>Growing up, my only exposure to &#x201c;gangs&#x201d; had been through the media or movies. My &#x201c;hip&#x201d; high school English teacher made us watch West Side Story to understand how the Montagues and the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet were like modern gangs. &#x201c;Gangs&#x201d; like the Jets and Sharks had staged rumbles. In real life, Jerome Robbins wasn&#x2019;t choreographing Friday&#x2013;night fights in Long Beach.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to see you get caught in the cross fire,&#x201d; Mark said. &#x201c;Just be careful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I said, hugging him good-bye. <br><br>The security guard, who had been eavesdropping on my entire conversation, said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, you know. Long Beach has changed a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, I just wanted to escape. I&#x2019;d had enough negativity for one day, so I ducked into the teachers&#x2019; lounge to seek solace. The moment I walked in, conversation stopped. They looked me up and down and said nothing. They didn&#x2019;t offer me a chair, a cup of coffee, or a word of encouragement. I looked down and noticed their open&#x2013;toed Birkenstocks, in earthy contrast to my pumps. I must have looked like I had just stepped out of a Talbot&#x2019;s catalog. I was definitely overdressed.<br><br>Their disapproving glances brought out insecurities that had never surfaced before. Obviously, I hadn&#x2019;t made a good first impression. Maybe it was the polka dots. Or maybe it was my Tiffany pearls that pushed it over the top. Even though I craved their acceptance, it was pretty obvious that these particular teachers didn&#x2019;t want me in their clique&#x2014;or their lounge, for that matter. Maybe I was too young, too preppy, or maybe they assumed I&#x2019;d been born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Their uncomfortable silence made it pretty obvious that they felt I didn&#x2019;t belong.<br><br>I stood against the wall and listened to disgruntled banter about the new crop of students dubbed as &#x201c;rejects.&#x201d; Apparently, my class was not the only place where things had gone awry. The teachers, many of whom had taught at Wilson since the &#x201c;good old days,&#x201d; were discussing how the school was &#x201c;going to hell in a handbasket.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This place has gone downhill ever since those kids started getting bussed in from the projects,&#x201d; one teacher said.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>They</i> don&#x2019;t even care about school,&#x201d; said another.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>They</i> don&#x2019;t care about anything!&#x201d; said another.<br><br>Their casual banter about those kids was startling. I was troubled by how nonchalant they were with their pejorative comments. After a string of generalizations about those kids, the teachers moved on to something more specific.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear about the latest disciplinary transfer from Poly?&#x201d; one of the teachers asked.<br><br>I instantly suspected that they were talking about Sharaud, because he had sauntered into my class wearing his Poly jersey. &#x201c;I heard he brought a gun to Poly last year and was planning to shoot everyone in the teachers&#x2019; lounge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I heard he was planning to shoot his English teacher,&#x201d; said another teacher.<br><br>&#x201c;They only let him in here because they couldn&#x2019;t find the gun. It&#x2019;s just a matter of time before that boy blows someone away,&#x201d; said another. <br><br>After being sufficiently ignored and hearing tales of how Sharaud would single-handedly destroy the institution. I decided I couldn't handle it anymore. I grabbed my bag and headed for the door. No one said good&#x2013;bye. Why would they? They hadn&#x2019;t even bothered to say hello.<br><br>I fumbled for my keys as I dashed to my car. The lingering conversation about Sharaud had struck fear into me. What if I was the next teacher who triggered him?</p><h2>Responding to Problem Behavior in Schools, Second Edition: The Behavior Education Program (The Guilford Practical Intervention in the Schools Series)</h2><p><p>This bestselling book has been used in schools across the country to establish efficient and cost-effective systems of Tier II positive behavior support.

Best known for his classics Alice s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass, and Jabberwocky, Carroll was also an accomplished inventor who created an early version of what is today known as Scrabble. The publication of Alice s Adventures in Wonderland in 1865 brought Carroll a certain level of fame, although he continued to supplement his income through his work as a mathematics tutor at Christ Church, Oxford College. Carroll s whimsical characters and nonsensical verse resonated with Victorian-era readers, and his books continue to be enjoyed by numerous modern societies dedicated to his promoting his works.</p><h2>The Cultural Contradictions Of Capitalism</h2><p>With a new afterword by the author, this classic analysis of Western liberal capitalist society contends that capitalism&#x2014;and the culture it creates&#x2014;harbors the seeds of its own downfall by creating a need among successful people for personal gratification&#x2014;a need that corrodes the work ethic that led to their success in the first place. With the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a new world order, this provocative manifesto is more relevant than ever.</p><p>Since its original publication in 1976, The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism has been hailed as an intellectual tour de force that redefines how we think about the relationship among econmomics, culture, and social change. Daniel Bell, the author of such other modern classics as The End of Ideology and The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, argues that the unbounded drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundations of the original Protestant ethic that ushered in capitalism itself. In a major new afterword, Bell offers a bracing perspective on contemporary Western society, from the end of the Cold War to the rise and fall of postmodernism, revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the twenty-first century approaches.<b>Daniel Bell</b> is the Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University and Scholar-in-Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Although architects in the United States and Canada began to identify themselves as professionals by the late eighteenth century, it was not until nearly a century later that North American universities began to offer formal architectural training; the first program was established at MIT in 1865. Today most architects receive their training within an academic setting that draws on the humanities, fine arts, applied science, and public service for its philosophy and methodology. This book, published in conjunction with the centennial of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA), provides the first comprehensive history of North American architecture education.</p><p><i>Architecture School</i> opens with six chronological essays, each devoted to a major period of development: before 1860; 1860&#x2013;1920; 1920&#x2013;1940; 1940&#x2013;1968; 1968&#x2013;1990; and 1990 to the present. This overview is followed by a &#x201c;lexicon&#x201d; containing shorter articles on more than two dozen topics that have figured centrally in archictecture education's history, from competitions and design pedagogy to research, structures, studio culture, and travel.</p></p><p>Joan Ockman is an architecture educator, historian, writer, and editor. Among the books she has edited are <i>Architecture Culture 1943&#x2013;1968</i>, <i>The Pragmatist Imagination</i>, and <i>Out of Ground Zero</i>.<p>The essays are fascinating, the authors well known, and the content relevant to architectural historians, authors, writers, critics, and students.</p>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br><p>Extremely well written, edited, and illustrated, this book should be of interest and value to architects and anyone who hopes to understand them.</p>&#x2015;<i>Oculus</i></p><h2>The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed the Jewish People</h2><p>The authors demonstrate that numerous Western countries, especially the United States and Great Britain, have conducted repeated and willful spying missions on Palestine and later Israel over many decades. While on the surface these two countries and others profess to be ardent allies of Israel, they work, in fact, through their intelligence services to betray Israel's secrets to the Arabs. Their motive: oil and multinational profits, which must be attained at any price through international covert policies.<br>To understand the duplicitous nature of the West's diplomatic relations with Israel, the authors contend that one must understand the history that begins after the end of World War I with the sordid Mideast exploits of a British diplomat, Jack Philby. They then proceed into a detailed discussion of the boardrooms of American and English bankers and lawyers who had strong connections with Nazi leaders and Arab oil tycoons in the 1930s prior to the outbreak of World War II. Particularly intriguing is the information that the writers present to suggest an all-too-cozy financial relationship that existed between the Allied intelligence community and German banks even during the war.<br>One of the authors' chief contentions is that Israel was the unwitting victim of bungled Western spy operations such as Iran-Contra and BCCI, whose true dimensions have never previously been exposed. A consistent theme is that the White House and the British Secret Service have repeatedly run illegal programs, hidden from both the CIA and Congress, and then used the Jews as scapegoats.</p><p>Attorney <b>John Loftus</b> is the author of four histories of intelligence operations and a consultant for CBS's <i>60 Minutes</i>, ABC's <i>Prime Time</i>, and other programs. As a former prosecutor with the U.S. Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit, he had unprecedented access to top-secret CIA and NATO archives. He wrote <i>Unholy Trinity: The Vatican, the Nazis, and Soviet Intelligence</i> with his coauthor, <b>Mark Aarons</b>. An internationally award-winning investigative reporter and author of several books on intelligence-related issues, Mr. Aarons exposed Nazi war criminals "down under" and prompted changes to Australian federal law. He lives in Sydney, Australia, where he formerly worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.<br>An alternative, conspiratorial retelling of major events of the last 75 years, from the authors of Unholy Trinity (1992). Former Justice Department Nazi-hunter Loftus and Australian journalist Aarons would have us believe that much of recent Western history has had as its common theme ``Get the Jews.'' However, they are far more convincing in arguing that the underlying motivations for most of the evil plots they describe were fanatical anti- communism and/or greed; Jews--mostly pre-1948 Zionists and post- 1948 Israelis--sometimes got in the way. Thus wealthy Americans invested in prewar Nazi Germany because there was money to be made, and Nazis were welcomed to postwar America as fighters against communism; the State Department and American boardrooms were filled with Arabists who had no sympathy for a Jewish state not because it was filled with Jews, but because it was empty of oil. Loftus and Aarons undermine their work by its enormous scope, which makes it virtually impossible to distinguish one chess-gambit conspiracy from another. Also, the sources for their most explosive revelations are ``confidential interviews'' with unnamed veterans of an alphabet soup of espionage agencies: Little hard evidence is presented. Still, like all good conspiracy books, this one offers plausible and intriguing explanations for gray areas of history. These range from how American companies wrested control of Saudi Arabia's oil fields from Great Britain in the 1920s and '30s to the way countries were convinced (blackmailed, say the authors, in a convoluted plot involving Nelson Rockefeller, who was allegedly selling oil to the Nazis all through WW II) to support the creation of Israel in 1948. The book is also enlivened by a rich rogues' gallery, including double (or maybe triple) agents Jack and Kim Philby; and John Foster and Allen Dulles, accused of subverting American foreign policy to their insatiable greed. A conspiracy book offering tasty morsels if one reads with a grain of salt and disregards its sensationalized and misleading title.

This device is capable of taking vibrant photographs in all but the most severe lighting situations or extreme conditions. Digital cameras, especially those in smartphones, have revolutionized the way we approach the world and interact with others. No experience is complete, no meal finished, no friendship consummated until we have taken a picture. The photograph replies, <i>I was here. </i>I witnessed this event, met this person, or relished this experience.<br><br>All too often, today&#x2019;s technology becomes a distraction that siphons your energy and diffuses your attention. But when you use a camera to look out at the world, your eyes may light on a gesture, an image, an expression&#x2014;and you experience the indispensable spark of awareness and presence. It&#x2019;s a flash of insight that can pierce the fog of your preoccupied mind and bring you closer to the living moment. The camera can help liberate your awareness to see clearly and keenly, to know something about who you really are, and to open your being to an unfading swell of empathy and compassion for those you meet along the way. The camera confirms the &#x201c;I am&#x201d; of being and existing in the world.<br> <i><br>Zen Camera </i>is not only about photography; it is about you. In six lessons, it guides you to cultivating creativity with a camera and in all areas of your life. It teaches you about deep perception, learning to see, and awakening all of your senses to the&nbsp;present moment. It helps you realize Socrates&#x2019;s great directive, <i>Know thyself, </i>and uncover the seeds of the authentic self, hidden behind multiple layers of conditioning and socialization. And yes, you&#x2019;ll also learn to take better photographs and to communicate effectively through images.&nbsp;<br><br>The six lessons found in the book are cyclic and hold many keys for your evolving work. They are relevant for anyone, whether you&#x2019;re a professional or have recently discovered a budding interest in using your smartphone camera. The lessons can be adapted to different stages of development. You may have taken thousands of photos and the technical aspects are familiar to you, but you&#x2019;re looking for fresh inspiration. Or you might have an inkling of what you want to express behind the camera but don&#x2019;t know the mechanics beyond point and click. Either way, this book is for you. The minimum time needed to fulfill a first pass of the lessons would be twelve to fifteen weeks, akin to a college semester, and they can be circled back to over the years. For me, the better part of a lifetime has been spent in their service with the aim of personal and artistic awakening.&nbsp;<br><br>This book has been taking shape in my mind for forty years. I am a professor of photography in a traditional college setting and have taught a wide variety of photography classes and workshops to people of diverse ages, cultural backgrounds, and professions. I&#x2019;ve taught children and adults in many places in the United States, including my current home of Hawai&#x2018;i, and developed photography programs in Hong Kong and China. Some of my students aspire to make photography a career, while others are searching for the richness of creative expression in their personal lives. I have seen countless students discover the great joy and fulfillment that comes from creative expression. They find hope and confidence, and give voice to features of their identity, either previously hidden or once blanketed in fear and uncertainty. When they uncover their unique vision, they awaken to their own potential.&nbsp;<br><br>As my students adopt photography as a means of personal growth, they begin to stretch beyond their perceived boundaries of thought and expression. I have been touched to the core and learned so much from their observations of the world through a camera. Their requests&#x2014;for tools, exercises, and guidance&#x2014;created this book. Its six lessons have proven their worth to generations of students. To my students, I owe my deepest gratitude.&nbsp;</p><h2>Basic Music Theory, 4th ed.: How to Read, Write, and Understand Written Music</h2><p>What do all those lines and squiggles and dots mean?Basic Music Theory takes you through the sometimes confusing world of written music with a clear, concise style that is at times funny and always friendly.The book is written by an experienced music teacher using methods refined over more than twenty years in schools and in his private teaching studio.

It tells the dreadful tale of Victor Frankenstein, a visionary young student of natural philosophy, who discovers the secret of life. In the grip of his obsession he constructs a being from dead body parts, and animates this creature. The results for Victor and for his family are catastrophic.<br> <br>Written when Mary Shelley was just eighteen,<em> Frankenstein</em> was inspired by the ghost stories and vogue for Gothic literature that fascinated the Romantic writers of her time. She transformed these supernatural elements into an epic parable that warned against the threats to humanity posed by accelerating technological progress. <br><br>Published for the 200th anniversary, this edition, based on the original 1818 text, explains in detail the turbulent intellectual context in which Shelley was writing, and also investigates how her novel has since become a byword for controversial practices in science and medicine, from manipulating ecosystems to vivisection and genetic modification. As an iconic study of power, creativity, and, ultimately, what it is to be human, <em>Frankenstein </em>continues to shape our thinking in profound ways to this day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nick Groom</strong> is Professor in English at the University of Exeter.

Keats died at the young age of twenty-five, leaving behind some of the most exquisite and moving verse and letters ever written, inspired by his deep love for Fanny. <i>Bright Star</i> is a collection of Keats' romantic poems and correspondence in the heat of his passion, and is a dazzling display of a talent cut cruelly short.</p><p>John Keats was born in October 1795, son of the manager of a livery stable in Moorfields. His father died in 1804 and his mother, of tuberculosis, in 1810. By then he had received a good education at John Clarke&#x2019;s Enfield private school. In 1811 he was apprenticed to a surgeon, completing his professional training at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital in 1816. His decision to commit himself to poetry rather than a medical career was a courageous one, based more on a challenge to himself than any actual achievement. <p>His genius was recognized and encouraged by early Mends like Charles Cowden Clarke and J. H. Reynolds, and in October 1816 he met Leigh Hunt, whose Examiner had already published Keats&#x2019;s first poem. Only seven months later Poems (1817) appeared. Despite the high hopes of the Hunt circle, it was a failure. By the time Endymion was published in 1818 Keats&#x2019;s name had been identified with Hunt&#x2019;s &#x2018;Cockney School&#x2019;, and the Tory <b>Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</b> delivered a violent attack on Keats as a lower-class vulgarian, with no right to aspire to &#x2018;poetry&#x2019;.</p><p>But for Keats fame lay not in contemporary literary politics but with posterity. Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth were his inspiration and challenge. The extraordinary speed with which Keats matured is evident from his letters. In 1818 he had worked on the powerful epic fragment Hyperion, and in 1819 he wrote &#x2018;The Eve of St Agnes&#x2019;, &#x2018;La Belle Dame sans Merci&#x2019;, the major odes, Lamia, and the deeply exploratory Fall of Hyperion. Keats was already unwell when preparing the 1820 volume for the press; by the time it appeared in July he was desperately ill. He died in Rome in 1821. Keats&#x2019;s final volume did receive some contemporary critical recognition, but it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that his place in English Romanticism began to be recognized, and not until this century that it became fully recognized.</p>Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art--<br>Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night<br>And watching, with eternal lids apart,<br>Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,<br>The moving waters at their priestlike task<br>Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,<br>Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask<br>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--<br>No--yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,<br>Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,<br>To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,<br>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,<br>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,<br>And so live ever--or else swoon to death.<br><br><p>La Belle Dame Sans Merci</p><p>Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight, <br>&nbsp;Alone and palely loitering; <br>The sedge is wither'd from the lake, <br>&nbsp;And no birds sing. </p><p>Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight, <br>&nbsp;So haggard and so woe-begone? <br>The squirrel's granary is full, <br>&nbsp;And the harvest's done. </p><p>I see a lily on thy brow, <br>&nbsp;With anguish moist and fever dew; <br> And on thy cheek a fading rose <br>&nbsp;Fast withereth too.</p><p>I met a lady in the meads <br>&nbsp;Full beautiful, a faery's child; <br>Her hair was long, her foot was light, <br>&nbsp;And her eyes were wild. </p><p>I set her on my pacing steed, <br>&nbsp;And nothing else saw all day long; <br> For sideways would she lean, and sing <br>&nbsp;A faery's song. </p><p>I made a garland for her head, <br>&nbsp;And bracelets too, and fragrant zone; <br>She look'd at me as she did love, <br>&nbsp;And made sweet moan. </p><p>She found me roots of relish sweet, <br>&nbsp;And honey wild, and manna dew; <br>And sure in language strange she said, <br>&nbsp;I love thee true. </p><p>She took me to her elfin grot, <br>&nbsp;And there she gaz'd and sighed deep, <br>And there I shut her wild sad eyes-- <br>&nbsp;So kiss'd to sleep. </p><p>And there we slumber'd on the moss, <br>&nbsp;And there I dream'd, ah woe betide, <br>The latest dream I ever dream'd <br>&nbsp;On the cold hill side. </p><p>I saw pale kings, and princes too, <br>&nbsp;Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; <br>Who cry'd--"La belle Dame sans merci <br>&nbsp;Hath thee in thrall!" </p><p>I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam <br>&nbsp;With horrid warning gaped wide, <br>And I awoke, and found me here <br>&nbsp;On the cold hill side.</p><p>And this is why I sojourn here <br>&nbsp;Alone and palely loitering, <br>Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake, <br>&nbsp;And no birds sing. </p></p><h2>The Essential Wilderness Navigator: How to Find Your Way in the Great Outdoors, Second Edition</h2><p>Now with full-color topographic maps and featuring the latest on electronic navigation, The Essential Wilderness Navigator is the clearest and most up-to-date route-finding primer available.

When Ronald Reagan moved into the White House in 1981, one of his first literary guests was Edmund Morris, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Theodore Roosevelt. Morris developed a fascination for the genial yet inscrutable President and, after Reagan's landslide reelection in 1984, put aside the second volume of his life of Roosevelt to become an observing eye and ear at the White House.<br><br>Coming and going with Reagan's benign approval ("I'm not going to ride up San Juan Hill for you"), Morris found the President to be a man of extraordinary power and mystery. Although the historic early achievements were plain to see--the restoration of American optimism and patriotism, a repowering of the national economy, a massive arms buildup deliberately forcing the "Evil Empire" of Soviet Communism to come to terms--nobody, let alone Reagan himself, could explain how he succeeded in shaping events to his will. And when Reagan's second term came to grips with some of the most fundamental moral issues of the late twentieth century--at Bitburg and Bergen-Belsen, at Geneva and Reykjav�k,publicly outside the Brandenburg Gate ("Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"), and deep within the mother monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church, Morris realized that he had taken on a subject of epic dimensions.<br><br>Thus began a long biographical pilgrimage to the heart of Ronald Reagan's mystery, beginning with his birth in 1911 in the heart of rural Illinois (where he is still remembered as "Dutch," the dreamy son of an alcoholic father and a fiercely religious mother) and progressing through the way stations of an amazingly varied career: young lifeguard (he saved seventy-seven lives), aspiring writer, ace sportscaster, film star, soldier,union leader, corporate spokesman, Governor, and President. Reagan granted Morris full access to his personal papers, including early autobiographical stories and a handwritten White House diary.<br><br>The pilgrimage climaxes in 1993, when, in a moment of aching poignancy, Morris escorts his aged and failing subject back up the stairs of his birthplace. "An odd, Dantesque reversal of roles had occurred, as if I were now the leader rather than the led."<br><br>During thirteen years of obsessive archival research and interviews with Reagan and his family, friends, admirers and enemies (the book's enormous dramatis personae includes such varied characters as Mikhail Gorbachev, Michelangelo Antonioni, Elie Wiesel, Mario Savio, Fran�ois Mitterrand, Grant Wood, and Zippy the Pinhead), Morris lived what amounted to a doppelg�nger life, studying the young "Dutch," the middle-aged "Ronnie," and the septuagenarian Chief Executive with a closeness and dispassion, not to mention alternations of amusement, horror,and amazed respect, unmatched by any other presidential biographer.<br><br>This almost Boswellian closeness led to a unique literary method whereby, in the earlier chapters of Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,Morris's biographical mind becomes in effect another character in the narrative, recording long-ago events with the same eyewitness vividness (and absolute documentary fidelity) with which the author later describes the great dramas of Reagan's presidency, and the tragedy of a noble life now darkened by dementia.<br><br>"I quite understand," the author has remarked, "that readers will have to adjust, at first, to what amounts to a new biographical style. But the revelations of this style, which derive directly from Ronald Reagan's own way of looking at his life, are I think rewarding enough to convince them that one of the most interesting characters in recent American history looms here like a colossus."</p><p>Why did Pulitzer-winning Theodore Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris controversially choose to write his authorized biography of Ronald Reagan in the form of a historical novel? There's a clue in a quote the book attributes to Jane Wyman, Reagan's first wife. As Ronnie speechified about the Red Menace at a 1940s Hollywood party, Wyman allegedly whispered to a friend, "I'm so bored with him, I'll either kill him or kill myself." This anecdote, if true, is more revealing than Nancy Reagan's charge in the book that Jane had attempted suicide to get Ronnie to marry her in the first place. Jane was no intellectual--Morris cracks that "If Jane had ever heard of Finland, she probably thought it was an aquarium"--but he found to his horror, after years of research, that he felt much the same as Wyman. Reagan was as boring as a box of rocks, as elusive as a ghost. <p> Decades before Alzheimer's clouded Reagan's mind, he showed a terrifying lack of human presence. "I was real proud when Dad came to my high school commencement," reports his son, Michael Reagan. After posing for photos with Michael and his classmates, the future president came up to him, looked right in his eyes, and said, "Hi, my name's Ronald Reagan. What's yours?" Poor Michael replied, "Dad, it's <i>me</i>. Your son. Mike." </p><p> Despite deep research and unprecedented access--no previous biography has ever been authorized by a sitting president--Morris could get no closer to Reagan's elusive soul than Reagan's own kids could. So Morris decided to dramatize Reagan's life with several invented characters--including a fictionalized version of himself and an imaginary gossip columnist who makes wicked comments on Reagan's career. This is one weird tactic, forcing the reader constantly to consult the footnotes at the back of the book to sort things out, and Morris makes it tougher by presenting his invented characters as real, even in the footnotes. </p><p> Ultimately, the hubbub over Morris's odd method is beside the point. His speculative entry into Reagan's life and mind is plausible, dramatic, literary, and lit by dazzling flashes of insight. The narrator watches the young Reagan as a lifeguard (years before the real Morris was born):</p><p> </p><blockquote> One tunnels along in a shroud of silvery bubbles, insulated from any sight or sound.... Others may swim alongside for a while, but their individuality tends to refract away, through the bubbles and the blur. Often I have marveled at Reagan's cool, unhurried progress through crises of politics and personnel, and thought to myself, <i>He sees the world as a swimmer sees it</i>. </blockquote><p> We cannot verify Morris's notion that Reagan probably approved the illegal Iran-Contra funding without having a clue it was illegal, or that the "Star Wars" program sprang from his love of Edgar Rice Burroughs's first novel, <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, which featured glass-domed cities. But however bizarre and ignorant his thoughts were, however cold his heart, Morris believes, the guy did crush the Evil Empire and achieve greatness. Morris achieves a kind of greatness, too, but one wishes he had written a more straightforward dramatization of history. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"A compelling, richly informative, conceptually courageous book that constitutes a relentless pursuit of truth . . . the most insightful book in print about Ronald Reagan and the meaning of his presidency."<br>-Baltimore Sun<br><br>"A powerful and surprising portrait of a great world leader."<br>-USA Today<br><br>"An absolute page-turner . . .

Now reaching its four hundredth anniversary, it remains one of the most frequently used Bibles in the English-speaking world, especially in America.<br> <br>Lavishly illustrated with reproductions from early editions of the KJB, <em>Bible: The Story of the King James Version</em> offers a vivid and authoritative history of this renowned translation, ranging from the Bible's inception to the present day. Gordon Campbell, a leading authority on Renaissance literatures, tells the engaging and complex story of how this translation came to be commissioned, who the translators were, and how the translation was accomplished. Campbell does not end with the printing of that first edition, but also traces the textual history from 1611 to the establishment of the modern text by Oxford University Press in 1769, shedding light on the subsequent generations who edited and interacted with the text and bringing to life the controversies surrounding later revisions. In addition, the author examines the reception of the King James Version, showing how its popularity has shifted through time and territory, ranging from adulation to deprecation and attracting the attention of a wide variety of adherents. Since the KJB is more widely read in America today than in any other country, Campbell pays particular attention to the history of the KJB in the United States. Finally, the volume includes appendices that contain short biographies of the translators and a guide to the 74-page preliminaries of the 1611 edition. <br> <br>A fitting tribute to the enduring popularity of the King James Version, <em>Bible</em> offers an illuminating history of this most esteemed of biblical translations.</p><p><br><strong>Gordon Campbell</strong> is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Leicester University.

Now, in <em>Royals and the Reich</em>, Jonathan Petropoulos uses unprecedented access to royal archives to tell the fascinating story of the Princes of Hesse and the important role they played in the Nazi regime. <br> Princes Philipp and Christoph von Hessen-Kassel, great-grandsons of Queen Victoria of England, had been humiliated by defeat in WWI and, like much of the German aristocracy, feared the social unrest wrought by the ineffectual Weimar Republic. Petropoulos shows how the princes, lured by prominent positions in the Nazi regime and highly susceptible to nationalist appeals, became enthusiastic supporters of Hitler. Prince Philipp, son-in-law to the King of Italy, became the highest-ranking prince in the Nazi state and developed a close personal relationship with Hitler and Hermann G�ring. Prince Christoph was a prominent SS officer and head of one of the most important intelligence agencies in the Third Reich. In return, the princes made the Nazis socially acceptable to wealthy, high-society patrons. Prince Philipp even introduced G�ring to Mussolini at a critical stage in the Nazi Party's development and later served as a liaison between Hitler and the Italian dictator.<br> Permitted access to Hessen family private papers and the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle, Petropoulos follows the story of the House of Hesse through to its tragic denouement--the princes' betrayal and persecution by an increasingly paranoid Hitler and prosecution and denazification by the Allies. <em>Royals and the Reich</em> is a startling and unique portrait of the vanished world of prewar aristocrats and a royal family caught in one of the most tumultuous periods in history.</p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Petropoulos</strong> is the John V. Croul Professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College. He is the author of <em>The Faustian Bargain</em> (OUP), which was named one of the 25 Books to Remember in 2000 by the New York Public Library. He was a Research Director on the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets and has served as an expert witness in cases involving Holocaust victims' assets. He lives in Claremont, California.<br><br>"A devastating portrait of how the highest social stratum in Germany enthusiastically embraced a movement that might truly be said to have come out of the gutter.... Although this book is full of facts and statistics...it is no mere dry historical text. Mr. Petropoulos knows just how to find telling pieces of evidence and to frame them with excellent commentard."--<em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"The very interesting and quite readable book sheds a great deal of light on what members of European royalty may or may not have know about Nazi criminality during World War Two, and what they certainly may not have shared with members of Western governments." --<em>The Jewish Press</em><p></p><br>"An enthralling book, well researched in archives and through interviews, including one with the Duke of Edinburgh himself.... <em>Royals and the Reich</em> gets the big picture right--and a disturbing, even sickening, one it is."--Martin Rubin, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"This lucid and thoroughly researched book throws much light on the fateful--and sometimes fatal--relationship between the highest reaches of Germany's aristocracy and the basest quarters of that nation's politics during the first half of the 20th century. Along the way, Jonathan Petropoulos illuminates the familial bonds among many European dynasties and their impact on a tumultuous era. All in all, a revealing, penetrating, fair-minded, and sometimes touching work."--Peter Hayes, Theodore Z. Weiss Professor of Holocaust Studies, Northwestern University, and author of <em>From Cooperation</em> <em>to Complicity: Degussa in the Third Reich</em> and <em>Industry and Ideology: IG Farben in the Nazi Era</em><p></p><br>"In spite of a silken curtain obscuring the roles of royal supporters of the Third Reich, there is here a first truly balanced, thoughtful, and engagingly written account of royal princes and others of noble rank based on unprecedented access to some of the hitherto secreted records. A major and most welcome achievement in opening to readers a world too often closed except for pictures and gossip."--Gerhard L. Weinberg, Professor of History Emeritus, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and author of <em>A World At Arms: A Global History of World War II</em> and <em>Visions of Victory: The Hopes</em> <em>of Eight World War II Leaders</em><p></p><br>"There is a cornucopia of literature analyzing the relationship between German social strata and the Nazis. What has been missing is an examination of the aristocracy. Using the example of the princely Hessen family, Jonathan Petropoulos now has begun to fill that void. The Hessens--and many of their relatives from other royal houses--sought accommodation with a movement which, from the outset, opposed monarchy. Petropoulos resolves this seeming contradiction with the help of interviews and rare private sources. His book is a pioneering contribution to the social history of the Third Reich." --Michael H. Kater, Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus of History at the Canadian Centre for German and European Studies, and author of <em>Hitler Youth</em> and <em>Different Drummers: Jazz in the Culture of Nazi Germany</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Linux Bible</h2><p><b>The industry favorite Linux guide, updated for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and the cloud</b> <p><i>Linux Bible, 9th Edition</i> is the ultimate hands-on Linux user guide, whether you're a true beginner or a more advanced user navigating recent changes.

In the twenty-first century, she has been resurrected as a serious reference point for mainstream figures, especially those on the political right from Paul Ryan to Donald Trump.&nbsp;<i>Mean Girl&nbsp;</i>follows Rand&#x2019;s trail through the twentieth century from the Russian Revolution to the Cold War and traces her posthumous appeal and the influence of her novels via her cruel, surly, sexy heroes. Outlining the impact of Rand&#x2019;s philosophy of selfishness,&nbsp;<i>Mean Girl&nbsp;</i>illuminates the Randian shape of our neoliberal, contemporary culture of greed and the dilemmas we face in our political present.</p><p>&#x201c;Lisa Duggan does a deep dive into Ayn Rand so that we don&#x2019;t have to. Instead, we can read Duggan&#x2019;s impassioned, insightful, sometimes terrifying, sometimes humorous account of Rand&#x2019;s philosophy and influence. Calls to understand and reject the allure of cruelty rarely feel as lucid and timely.&#x201d;&#x2014;Maggie Nelson, author of&nbsp;<i>The Argonauts</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The self-described &#x2018;man worshipper&#x2019; Ayn Rand titillated generations of strivers with her gospel of free-reign capitalism as the apex of human achievement.

Exalted are the profit-driven for they will inherit the earth? How could anyone come to embrace smug indifference to the suffering of others as worthy of admiration?

The whole package of power-love associated with Rand throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries&#x2014;biography, economics, cultural politics, white masculinity, authoritarianism, sexual violence&#x2014;comes vividly to life here in Lisa Duggan&#x2019;s beautiful, stunning rendering.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lauren Berlant, coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Sex, or the Unbearable</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sometimes, in the right hands, a single figure can help make sense of an era.

An individualist who built a cult, a critic of the masses whose career depended on their media, an Objectivist who marketed her philosophy via novels soaked in sex and sentimentality, Rand aggrandized greed as a virtue and was the unapologetic purveyor of what Duggan brilliantly calls&nbsp;&#x2018;optimistic cruelty.&#x2019;&nbsp;This short, accessible, and powerful book charts the rise of affective neoliberalism through the lens of a life.

In a historical moment in which billionaires have been refashioned into super-beings, Duggan&#x2019;s history of this libertarian matriarch provides a necessary and eye-opening intervention.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roderick Ferguson, author of&nbsp;<i>One-Dimensional Queer</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reading Lisa Duggan&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Mean Girl</i>&nbsp;is an exercise in emotional upheaval. One minute I was laughing out loud, the next crying into my tea, and then finally feeling confident that human beings cannot allow the suffocation of Ayn Rand&#x2019;s thinking to get to us.

This first full-scale treatment of the subject follows a truly interdisciplinary approach, applying to the early medieval period a sociohistorical method similar to that which has already proven fruitful in explicating the history of Early Christianity and Late Antiquity. The encounter of the Germanic peoples with Christianity is studied from within the larger context of the encounter of a predominantly "world-accepting" Indo-European folk-religiosity with predominantly "world-rejecting" religious movements. While the first part of the book develops a general model of religious transformation for such encounters, the second part applies this model to the Germano-Christian scenario. Russell shows how a Christian missionary policy of temporary accommodation inadvertently contributed to a reciprocal Germanization of Christianity.<br></p><p>While historians of Christianity have generally acknowledged some degree of Germanic influence in the development of early medieval Christianity, Russell goes further, arguing for a fundamental Germanic reinterpretation of Christianity.

The politics of the small colony, the influence of the matriarchal society and the dominating presence of the Catholic Church are woven into the fabric of the story to provide a compelling portrait of ordinary life in Belize. </p></p><p>Zee Edgell is from Belize. She is the author of Beka Lamb and In Times Like These.Twelve-year-old Beka Lamb lives in Belize City, "a relatively tolerant town" where people with their roots in Africa, the West Indies, Central America, Europe, North America, Asia, and other places, "lived in a kind of harmony. In three centuries, miscegenation, like logwood, had produced all shades of black and brown, not grey or purple or violet." Beka knows her family's history from Gran who tells of "befo' time," when they were slaves, and now, when Beka can win an essay contest at the Convent school: "Befo' time... Beka would never have won that contest... But things can change fi true." And change they do. Before she won the essay contest, Beka's days were filled with family, domestic work, food, school, neighbors, politics, hurricanes, and dreaming with her best friend, fourteen-year-old Toycie. Before the contest, Sundays were the days she and Toycie walked Beka's baby brother through the rich neighborhoods to the seashore and planned the redecorating they would do when they owned the houses they passed, the days Beka waited patiently while Toycie talked to her boyfriend. Before the contest, Beka lied, got caught, got punished, and lied again. Before the contest, Toycie was still alive. <b>Beka Lamb</b> is a beautiful and lovingly told story of a few months in the life of a young woman growing up in a time and place of constant change. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Dynamics</h2><p>Continuing in the spirit of its successful previous editions, the tenth edition of Beer, Johnston, Mazurek, and Cornwell's <i>Vector Mechanics for Engineers</i> provides conceptually accurate and thorough coverage together with a significant refreshment of the exercise sets and online delivery of homework problems to your students.

Bloom and her colleagues have come to believe that unresolved, multi-generational, often forgotten trauma leads to a compulsion to repeat that is a powerful force in individual and social history. Because of this unresolved legacy of trauma, all of our social systems are "trauma-organized," producing institutions which are unresponsive to and often directly counter to human needs. <br> <br> <em>Creating Sanctuary</em> presents the thesis that effective social reconstruction is only effective if we understand the biological, psychological, social, and moral legacy of trauma.</p><p><strong>Dr. Sandra Bloom</strong> is the Executive Director of the Sanctuary at Friends Hospital in Philadelphia and President of the Alliance for Creative Development.

In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother.ON the twenty-sixth my father drove off to Salla at two o&#39;clock in the morning to see to a schoolteacher whom he found dying and left dead. From there he set out toward Hullberg to treat a child who had fallen into a hog tub full of boiling water that spring. Discharged from the hospital weeks ago, it was now back with its parents.He liked seeing the child, and dropped by there whenever he could. The parents were simple people, the father a miner in Koflach, the mother a servant in a butcher&#39;s household in Voitsberg. But the child was not left alone all day; it was in the care of one of the mother&#39;s sisters. On this day my father described the child to me in greater detail than ever before, adding that he was afraid it had only a short time to live. &#34;I can say for a certainty that it won&#39;t last through the winter, so I am going to see it as often as possible now,&#34; he said. It struck me that he spoke of the child as a beloved person, very quietly and without having to consider his words. He let himself express a natural affection for the child as he hinted at the surroundings in which the child had grown up, not so much reared as guarded by its parents, and explained his speculations about these parents and their relationship to the child by filling out the details of the environment. While he spoke, he paced back and forth in his room, and soon no longer had the slightest need to lie down again.My father was the only doctor in a relatively large and &#34;difficult&#34; district, now that the other doctor had moved to Graz, where he had accepted a teaching post at the university. &#34;The chance of a replacement,&#34; my father said, &#34;is practically nil. A man would be mad to want to start a practice here.&#34; For his own part, he said, he was used to sacrificing himself to a sick populace given to violence as well as insanity. My being home for the weekend was a tranquilizer for him, he said, and one that was more and more necessary. He seemed tired. But when I threw open the shutters and the light from the Ache river dazzled us, he said he would take a walk. &#34;Come,&#34; he said, &#34;come along.&#34; While I was dressing, he talked about a &#34;phenomenon of nature,&#34; a chestnut tree that had burst into blossom now, at the end of September. He had discovered it by the riverside beyond the village. This would be a good opportunity, he said, for us to discuss something he had long wanted to talk about. Probably, I thought, something connected with my studies in Leoben, something to do with mining. This was the right time for it, he said, before he was taken up with the day&#39;s quota of patients. &#34;You know,&#34; he said, &#34;often it&#39;s all too much for me.&#34;We did not want to wake my sister, and went out to the vestibule for our coats as quietly as possible. But as we were about to leave the house, the bell rang. At the door stood someone I did not know, who turned out to be an innkeeper from Gradenberg. He asked my father to come with him at once.And so we rode to Gradenberg in the innkeeper&#39;s wagon instead of strolling along the Ache and having our discussion. There was no more talk about the flowering chestnut tree. Instead we heard a most unsettling tale about the innkeeper&#39;s wife.She had been busy until two o&#39;clock in the morning, her husband said, serving miners who had already been drunk for several hours and had divided into two hostile groups. Suddenly one of the miners without the slightest provocation struck her on the head, and she had dropped unconscious to the floor. The horrified miners carried her up to the bedroom on the second floor of the inn, her head bumping several times against the banister, and deposited her on her bed. Her husband woke up when the miners opened the bedroom door, and listened, dazed from sleep, to an account of the incident. The suddenly sobered miners wanted him to go to the police and lodge a complaint at once, that very night, against the assailant, a man named Grossl, who had run off but whom they all could identify. The police, including the constable supposedly on duty, had all been asleep, the innkeeper said. But by showering the police station windows with pebbles he had finally roused someone and been admitted. At first the police had advised him to come back in the forenoon to make a statement for the record, but he had insisted that the statement be recorded right then and there, and demanded that some of the constables at least come to the inn with him because his wife was lying there unconscious, the miners were still waiting, and he felt that they, too, should present their statements without delay. But the whole thing had taken too long; by the time he returned to the inn with two of the constables, all the miners except one were gone. His first thought was that he should not have left his wife alone for a moment, for as he entered the bedroom and saw the miner Kolig, who had been there all this time, the most horrible suspicions and imaginings ran through his mind. He did not know the man at all well, was acquainted with him merely from his occasional visits to the inn, and did not regard him as a neighbor in the sense of his being trustworthy. Moreover the miner spoke a Styrian dialect unpleasantly different from the dialect of the vicinity.Albert Kolig was so drunk that though still on his feet he could not speak even the shortest sentence. The younger of the constables promptly told him to sit down in the armchair in the corner and began questioning him, while the other constable took pictures of the woman lying on the bed as motionless as if she were a corpse. The answers Kolig gave for the record were in fact useless. He could not sit up and was on the point of keeling over when the constable, losing patience, pulled him up and yanked and shoved him out into the hall.The culprit, Grossl, was reputed to be the kind of man who the moment he entered a tavern was bound to stay until he had made some kind of ruckus. The constables said that it would not be difficult to find him and in view of his previous convictions the chances were that he would be in for a sentence of several years, since the facts of the case were plain enough: The blow on the woman&#39;s head had evidently caused a severe injury, for otherwise she would not be still unconscious. As soon as the older constable spoke the words &#34;severe injury,&#34; everyone realized that a doctor would have to be called. &#34;Meanwhile several hours have passed,&#34; the innkeeper said.It was already half past four when we arrived in Gradenberg. The innkeeper led us up to the bedroom, where the two constables were standing. My father had all of us go out into the hall. While he was examining the woman--in my brief glimpse of her I had the impression that she had given up the ghost--the two constables in the corridor discussed Kolig, who lay in a drunken stupor on the floor. They said he was dimwitted and was treating his family of six more and more vilely. They did not know what to do with him. When my father emerged from the bedroom, they dragged Kolig away from the stairs, which he had half blocked with his legs. Then they paid no more attention to him.The woman was in fact seriously injured and had to be taken to the Koflach hospital at once, my father said. He asked the constables to carry her carefully downstairs and place her in the rack wagon.The constables carried the innkeeper&#39;s wife out of the damp room with its green and brown wallpaper and cheap pine furniture, a room that must have been gloomy even on the brightest day. As the constables cautiously descended the steps with their charge, my father looked at me and then past me, and I thought that his look boded very ill for the innkeeper&#39;s wife.While I took my seat in the wagon beside the innkeeper, who drove, my father sat behind us next to the patient.During the whole ride, which we shortened by cutting across Krennhof, the innkeeper and I did not exchange a word. Because of the early hour the drive went quickly and easily. I had not been in this vicinity for a long time, I realized. I had to think far back to my earliest childhood to catch a glimpse of myself here and there playing by Gradner Brook. It struck me how seldom I had accompanied my father on his rounds, and that ever since my mother&#39;s death I had been left entirely to myself. It is the same for my sister, who must be feeling it even more painfully than I.In keeping with our mood, I imagine, the innkeeper, who had talked so much on the way to Gradenberg, did not say a word on the way to Koflach. It would hardly have been fitting for me to strike up any conversation with him. If I had understood my father right, there was little hope that the woman would survive the ride to Koflach. But when the hospital attendants lifted her out of the wagon, she was not yet dead. She died, however, while we were still in the hospital, before she could be brought into the only operating room, and her husband sensed the moment of her passing. While the attendants were wheeling her down the corridor, he had held her hand and wept. They did not let him stay with the body, but led him down to the courtyard where, left entirely to himself, he had to wait half an hour for my father. I let him alone, but unobtrusively kept watch over him. Then my father came down and walked about the yard with him, trying to calm him. He spoke to the innkeeper of the things that had to be done now, about arranging the funeral, the inquest, filing a charge against Grossl for manslaughter. It would be wise for him to stay around people now, my father said, not to isolate himself in his anguish, withdraw into his pain. My father said he would take care of certain necessary errands, like going to court, and would accompany him on others to ease his grief, first of all to see his wife who was being moved to the autopsy room.My father said that he had diagnosed a cerebral hemorrhage, which would have been fatal in any case. He would be receiving the exact details of the autopsy from the district coroner later in the morning. It was of no importance that the innkeeper had not notified him of the fatal blow until three hours after the incident, my father said. The woman could not have been saved. The deceased woman was thirty-three, and my father had known her for years. It had always seemed to him that innkeepers treated their wives with extreme callousness, he said. They themselves usually went to bed early, having overworked themselves all day on their slaughtering, their cattle dealing, their farms. But because they thought of nothing but the business, they left their wives to take care of the taverns until the early morning hours, exposed to the male clients who drank steadily so that as the night wore on their natural brutality became less and less restrained. My father said this to me in an interval when we fell a bit behind the innkeeper, who was walking with us but seemed in a total daze. &#34;All these long drinking bouts end badly,&#34; my father said. &#34;And in this region a high percentage of them end in a fatality. The innkeepers&#39; own wives are often the victims; the innkeepers set these helpless women to tending the public rooms so they can extract every penny from their drunken patrons by pouring the cheapest brandy into their unresisting guts.&#34;When we had caught up to the innkeeper again, my father assured him that it would be easy to find Grossl now that the police were informed of it all. No matter where he was holed up, Grossl would not be able to stay hidden long. The innkeeper&#39;s tears and distraught air were affecting precisely because his dealings with cattle and the tavern world had made him the embodiment of the district&#39;s characteristic brutality. But the more my father tried to talk to him, the more pointless the effort seemed. Finally my father contented himself with giving the man the necessary instructions in what I thought a very simple and easily understood way. Then we left him to himself again.My father went to the autopsy room and talked with the coroner and his assistants. Meanwhile I kept an eye on the innkeeper as he sat on the single bench in the hospital yard. I guessed that his wife&#39;s body was in the two-wheeled morgue cart that a young attendant pushed past me. The sight of the morgue cart was nothing new to me, for my way to school had led past the hospital and I often used to pause at the spot where the morgue could be seen between two elderberry bushes so I could look at the cart that stood by the entrance to the morgue day and night when it was not in use. It was housed in an open shed on the side of the building visible to me. This sheet-metal morgue cart had always had a macabre fascination for me, and often appeared as a major, horrible prop on the stage of my childhood dreams. The young attendant, barely past school age, pushed the cart to the entrance of the morgue, and I heard my father coming from that direction. We went out of the hospital yard, moving quickly along the walls so as to keep out of sight of the innkeeper, who was still sitting on the bench. My father, I thought, wherever he feels at home, which is with patients and in hospitals, doesn&#39;t act as if he were part of a vast, opaque business organization, though that&#39;s what people accuse doctors of nowadays, but rather as I&#39;ve seen him act today, as if he were part of a more and more crystal-clear science. I suppose there are many doctors like some I have met who are nothing but businessmen, and talk and act like businessmen even when they have keen scientific minds. But my father isn&#39;t one of them.</p><h2>Handbook For Writing Proposals, Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>Proven techniques and invaluable advice for writing winning business proposals&#x2015;revised and updated!</b></p> <p>What makes a winning business proposal?

Then there&#39;s tomboy Jo who longs to be a writer. Sweet-natured Beth always puts others first, and finally there&#39;s Amy, the youngest and most precocious. Together they are the March sisters. Even though money is short, times are tough and their father is away at war, their infectious sense of fun sweeps everyone up in their adventures -- including Laurie, the boy next door. And through sisterly squabbles, their happy times and sad ones too, the sisters discover that growing up is sometimes very hard to do. &#34;Little Women&#34; by Louisa May Alcott is one of the twelve wonderful classic stories being relaunched in &#34;Puffin Classics&#34; in March 2008.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettesThis American classic is as fresh and meaningful today as it was when it was first written in the 19th century. Largely based on the author's own childhood, <i>Little Women</i> is a timeless tale of the four young March sisters&#x2014;Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy&#x2014;who grow to maturity in their mother's tender but strong care. As different in their personalities as they are alike in their devotion to each other, the girls vow to support their beloved mother, Marmee, by behaving their best while Father is away, serving as an army chaplain in the Civil War.<br>Literary-minded tomboy Jo develops a fast friendship with the boy next door, and pretty Meg, the eldest, finds romance; frail and affectionate Beth fills the house with music, and little Amy, the youngest, seeks beauty with all the longing of an artist's soul. Although poor in material wealth, the family possesses an abundance of love, friendship, and imaginative gifts that captivate readers time and again.</p><h2>Exploring the Way Life Works: The Science of Biology: The Science of Biology</h2><p>The Way Life Works is the perfect answer for any instructor seeking a more concise, meaningful, and flexible alternative to the standard introductory biology text.<br><br>Organized around one central idea &#x2013; the amazing unity that underlies biological diversity &#x2013; this book presents biology's basic concepts and applications through a brilliant interweaving of incisive explanations, imaginative analogies, and stunning visual graphics.<br><br>The process of science is strongly emphasized, and specific historical and current research is presented to elucidate the achievements of scientific exploration and the roles of curiosity and observation in initiating the scientific process.<br><br>Easily adaptable to multiple teaching styles, this irresistably readable, innovative, and engaging new textbook is guaranteed to inspire both teachers and students alike.</p><p>I can think of virtually no better book for introducing children or biology-impaired adults to the wonders of the machinery of life, from the molecular to the macroevolutionary.

People who have never thought much about the brain will be intrigued, but so will those who, like me, have spent most of their lives thinking about the brain. It is truly a breath of fresh air."</p><p>-David Hubel, Nobel Laureate, Harvard University, author of Eye, Brain, and Vision</p><p>"An extraordinary book by a remarkable scientist! Ramachandran is in many ways the modern Paul Broca, the great French neurologist who opened up the biological analysis of higher mental functions by studying patients with brain lesions. In a similar vein Ramachandran has used the study of patients to elucidate a range of fascinating mental functions. His insights have stimulated discussions in neuroscience over the last 25 years. Here is Ramachandran at his best; his most lucid and creative."</p><p>-Eric R. Kandel, M.D., Nobel Laureate, Columbia University</p><p>" Ramachandran is a latter-day Marco Polo, journeying the silk road of science to strange and exotic Cathays of the mind. He returns laden with phenomenological treasures...which, in his subtle and expert telling, yield more satisfying riches of scientific understanding."</p><p>-Richard Dawkins, Oxford University, author of The Blind Watchmaker</p><p>"An unusually clever neuroscientist explains baffling cases in neurology and neuropsychiatry and concludes that brain science can now resolve many of the age-old quanderies of philosophers. A thought-provoking, wonderful read."</p><p>-Roger Guillemin, Nobel Laureate, The Salk Institute</p><p>"Today we' re going through a revolution in neuroscience. The tidal wave of new researchcan be overwhelming, but V. S. Ramachandran, drawing on his own pioneering work on patients, succeeds in creating a witty, elegant introduction to the mysteries and revelations to be found within our skulls."</p><p>-Carl Zimmer, author of Soul Made Flesh</p><p>"V. S. Ramachandran is one of our most gifted physicians and expositors, and in this new book he illuminates everything he touches--whether it is phantom limbs and how they can be ' cured'; or how the brain can generate illusions and delusions; or synesthesia and its relation to metaphor, creativity, and art; or the ultimate questions of how brain relates to mind." A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness belongs to that rare category of scientific book, one as accessible as it is deep."</p><p>Oliver Sacks, M.D.</p><p>How can some people come to believe that their poodle is an impostor?

The first chapter shows how amputees feel pain in limbs they no longer have as it introduces the great revolution of our age: neuroscience. The second chapter walks through how what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing. The third chapter takes a leap beyond cutting edge science to audaciously set out a general theory of beauty, explaining why, the world over, cultures have fundamentally similar notions of what isattractive. The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S. Ramachandran, one of the foremost neuroscientists in the world today, sums up the implications of the revolution in our understanding of consciousness to make a fascinating argument about our essential sense of self and its distributed nature.</p><p>Take a tour with the perfect guide to one of the strangest places in the natural world, the human mind.</p><p>V.

Featuring mundane subjects photographed prosaically, with idiosyncratically deadpan titles, these &#x201c;small books&#x201d; were sought after, collected, and loved by Ruscha's fans and fellow artists. Over the past thirty years, close to 100 other small books that appropriated or paid homage to Ruscha's have appeared throughout the world. This book collects ninety-one of these projects, showcasing the cover and sample layouts from each along with a description of the work. It also includes selections from Ruscha's books and an appendix listing all known Ruscha book tributes.</p><p>These small books revisit, imitate, honor, and parody Ruscha in form, content, and title. Some rephotograph his subjects: <i>Thirtyfour Parking Lots, Forty Years Later</i>. Some offer a humorous variation: <i>Various Unbaked Cookies</i> (which concludes, as did Ruscha's Various <i>Small Fires</i>, with a glass of milk), <i>Twentynine Palms</i> (twenty-nine photographs of palm-readers' signs). Some say something different: <i>None of the Buildings on Sunset Strip</i>. Some reach for a connection with Ruscha himself: <i>17 Parked Cars in Various Parking Lots Along Pacific Coast Highway Between My House and Ed Ruscha's</i>.</p><p>With his books, Ruscha expanded the artist's field of permissible subjects, approaches, and methods. With <i>VARIOUS SMALL BOOKS</i>, various artists pay tribute to Ed Ruscha and extend the legacy of his books.</p></p><p>Jeff Brouws is a photographer whose work is in many private and public collections, including Harvard's Fogg Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Princeton University Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Her homage to Ruscha is <i>Real Estate Opportunities</i>.<br><br>Hermann Zschiegner is a principal in the award-winning New York&#x2013;based design agency TWO-N, a member of the ABC Artists' Book Cooperative, and the author of <i>Thirtyfour Parking Lots on Google Earth</i>.<i>Various Small Books: Referencing Various Small Books by Ed Ruscha</i> neatly captures the books-within-a-book concept of this bibliophilic delight, a collection of cover and sample-spread illustrations (with dryly witty descriptions by Phil Taylor) assembled from the seemingly endless homages by other artists to Ruscha&#x2019;s <i>Twentysix Gasoline Stations</i> and his subsequent, similarly deadpan, photo books (including the classic <i>Every Building on the Sunset Strip</i>). More than ninety examples are presented, from Bruce Nauman&#x2019;s caustic 1969 <i>Burning Small Fires</i>, whose images document the incineration of a copy of Ruscha&#x2019;s <i>Various Small Fires and Milk</i>, to more recent examples of books spinning off Ruscha&#x2019;s seminal series. &#x2014;Christopher Lyon</p><h2>Joy For The Journey A Woman&#39;s Book Of Joyful Promises</h2><p><p>More than 600,000 copies of this best-selling promise book for women have been sold since its debut in 1997.

G. Wodehouse is recognized as the greatest English comic writer of the twentieth century. His characters and settings have entered our language and our mythology. Launched on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, the Overlook Wodehouse will eventually contain all the novels and stories, edited and reset. Each Overlook volume will be the finest edition of the master ever published . . . and we're over two-thirds of the way there! <br> In Galahad at Blandings, Lord Emsworth's idyllic demesne, Blandings Castle, is as usual overrun with overbearing sisters, overefficient secretaries, and the lovestruck; even worse, an alleged old flame has appeared, determined to put an end to the Earl's peaceful, pig-loving existence. All Galahad's genius is required to sort things out satisfactorily.</p><p><b>P. G. Wodehouse</b> (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.Lord Emsworth&#39;s prized pig, the Empress of Blandings, is at the center of Wodehouse&#39;s hilarious tale of mistaken identity, the triumph of young love, and general mayhem among the twits at Blandings Castle. Jeremy Sinden gives a wonderful performance, using a completely difference voice for each character through layers and layers of zany dialogue. Especially delightful is Sinden&#39;s depiction of the aunts, those fearsome, intrepid ladies encrusted with family jewels and names like Hermoine and Daphne. Although Wodehouse published the Blandings novels in the mid-sixties, his stories and characters are finding new fans in every generation. Productions of this quality will ensure continuing popularity. Oh, quite! B.V.

Together with a more detailed understanding of disease processes, this knowledge is stimulating new approaches to therapeutic strategies involving gene therapy, growth factors and retinal cell transplantation.&nbsp; <p>Molecular genetic studies have provided detailed information on the pathogenesis of retinal dystrophies.&nbsp;An important proof of principle that gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of these conditions was demonstrated in the <i>rds</i> mouse: introduction of a functional copy of the <i>peripherin</i> gene subretinally resulted in complete rescue of rod outer segment structure. Novel approaches are being developed based on the manipulation of biochemical pathways that previously were not considered relevant to these diseases.&nbsp;For example, renewed interest in retinal dystrophy pathogenesis led to the successful use of high dose vitamin A treatment in Sorsby fundus dystrophy.&nbsp;</p> <p>This important new book covers all aspects of retinal dystrophies from the molecular and developmental biology of these disorders to possible therapeutic approaches, with special reference to gene therapy. Specific chapters deal with the molecular genetics of gene therapies, clinical genetic studies, molecular and cellular mechanisms of the development of the disease, functional genomics of retinal diseases, animal models of retinal dystrophies, and finally with studies on gene therapeutic approaches to correcting the disorder. With contributions by many of the leading researchers worldwide, this book is likely to be an important milestone in this rapidly developing field.</p></p><p>The <strong>Novartis Foundation</strong> is an international scientific and educational charity which promotes the study and general knowledge of science and in particular encourages international co-operation in scientific research....&#34;as a broad perspective...it is a valuable text...&#34; (The Biochemist Online, 15 June 2004)</p><h2>The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries</h2><p><p>Based on research in the Inquisitorial archives of Northern Italy, <i>The Night Battles</i> recounts the story of a peasant fertility cult centered on the <i>benandanti</i>, literally, "good walkers." These men and women described fighting extraordinary ritual battles against witches and wizards in order to protect their harvests. While their bodies slept, the souls of the <i>benandanti</i> were able to fly into the night sky to engage in epic spiritual combat for the good of the village. Carlo Ginzburg looks at how the Inquisition's officers interpreted these tales to support their world view that the peasants were in fact practicing sorcery. The result of this cultural clash, which lasted for more than a century, was the slow metamorphosis of the <i>benandanti</i> into the Inquisition's mortal enemies�&#x20ac;&#x201d;witches.</p><p>Relying upon this exceptionally well-documented case study, Ginzburg argues that a similar transformation of attitudes�&#x20ac;&#x201d;perceiving folk beliefs as diabolical witchcraft�&#x20ac;&#x201d;took place all over Europe and spread to the New World.

In it Walpole attempted, as he declared in the Preface to the Second Edition, "to blend the two kinds of romance: the ancient and the modern." Crammed with invention, entertainment, terror, and pathos, the novel was an immediate success and Walpole's own favorite among his numerous works. The novel is reprinted here from a text of 1798, the last that Walpole himself prepared for the press.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Published on Christmas Eve, 1764, on Walpole's private press at Strawberry Hill, his Gothicized country house, The Castle of Otranto became an instant and immediate classic of the Gothic genre as well as the prototype for Gothic fiction for the next two hundred years. Walpole's brooding and intense drama, The Mysterious Mother, focuses on the protagonist's angst over an act of incest with his mother, and includes the appearance of Father Benedict, Gothic literature's first evil monk. Appendices in this edition include selections from Walpole&#x2019;s letters, contemporary responses, and writings illustrating the aesthetic and intellectual climate of the period. Also included is Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s introduction to the 1811 edition of The Castle of Otranto.E. J.

It will leave you speechless."</b></p><p>Written in Paris after the heady days of student revolt in May 1968 and before the devastation of the AIDS epidemic, History of Shit is emblematic of a wild and adventurous strain of 1970s' theoretical writing that attempted to marry theory, politics, sexuality, pleasure, experimentation, and humor. Radically redefining dialectical thought and post-Marxist politics, it takes an important&#x2015;and irreverent&#x2015;position alongside the works of such postmodern thinkers as Foucault, Deleuze, Guattari, and Lyotard. Laporte's eccentric style and ironic sensibility combine in an inquiry that is provocative, humorous, and intellectually exhilarating. Debunking all humanist mythology about the grandeur of civilization, History of Shit suggests instead that the management of human waste is crucial to our identities as modern individuals&#x2015;including the organization of the city, the rise of the nation-state, the development of capitalism, and the mandate for clean and proper language. Far from rising above the muck, Laporte argues, we are thoroughly mired in it, particularly when we appear our most clean and hygienic. Laporte's style of writing is itself an attack on our desire for "clean language." Littered with lengthy quotations and obscure allusions, and adamantly refusing to follow a linear argument, History of Shit breaks the rules and challenges the conventions of "proper" academic discourse.</p></p><p>Dominique Laporte, who died in 1984 at the age of thirty-five, was a psychoanalyst and the coauthor of Fran�ais national: Politique et practiques de la langue nationale sous la R�volution Fran�aise.<p>According to Jacques Lacan, humans distinguish themselves from animals the moment shit becomes for them an embarrassing leftover, a source of shame, something to be secretly disposed of. As such, shit casts its shadow even at the most sublime moments of human experience. In ancient Greek theatres, a hole in the middle of the large stone seats in the front rows allowed members of the privileged classes to undergo a double katharsis&#x2015;a spiritual purification by which their souls were cleansed of bad emotions and a bodily purification to eliminate bad-smelling excrement. Far from being a theoretical joke about the unmentionable 'that,' Laporte's History of Shit confronts the most fundamental issues of what it means to be human. This book is a test for everyone who claims, 'nothing human is foreign to me'!</p>&#x2015;<b>Slavoj Zizek</b><br><br><p>The <i>History of Shit</i> is mesmerizing, important, and inspired, a perfectly balanced work where the unearthed information is as voluminous and revealing as Laporte's prose is fascinatingly abridged and exquisite.</p>&#x2015;<b>Dennis Cooper</b>, author of <i>Frisk</i></p><h2>Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy (Princeton Classics)</h2><p><p>Evil threatens human reason, for it challenges our hope that the world makes sense. For eighteenth-century Europeans, the Lisbon earthquake was manifest evil. Today we view evil as a matter of human cruelty, and Auschwitz as its extreme incarnation. Examining our understanding of evil from the Inquisition to contemporary terrorism, Susan Neiman explores who we have become in the three centuries that separate us from the early Enlightenment. In the process, she rewrites the history of modern thought and points philosophy back to the questions that originally animated it.</p><p>Whether expressed in theological or secular terms, evil poses a problem about the world's intelligibility. It confronts philosophy with fundamental questions: Can there be meaning in a world where innocents suffer? Can belief in divine power or human progress survive a cataloging of evil? Is evil profound or banal? Neiman argues that these questions impelled modern philosophy. Traditional philosophers from Leibniz to Hegel sought to defend the Creator of a world containing evil. Inevitably, their efforts--combined with those of more literary figures like Pope, Voltaire, and the Marquis de Sade--eroded belief in God's benevolence, power, and relevance, until Nietzsche claimed He had been murdered. They also yielded the distinction between natural and moral evil that we now take for granted. Neiman turns to consider philosophy's response to the Holocaust as a final moral evil, concluding that two basic stances run through modern thought. One, from Rousseau to Arendt, insists that morality demands we make evil intelligible. The other, from Voltaire to Adorno, insists that morality demands that we don't.</p><p>Beautifully written and thoroughly engaging, this book tells the history of modern philosophy as an attempt to come to terms with evil. It reintroduces philosophy to anyone interested in questions of life and death, good and evil, suffering and sense.</p></p><p><p>"This is a splendid book; it will be widely read and much discussed. Working from the assumption that philosophers ought to attend to 'the questions that brought us here,' Susan Neiman has given us a brilliant reading of those who have done just that. Her history of philosophy is also a philosophical argument: that evil is the central question driving the best modern philosophy, and that it is not only a moral question but a metaphysical one. The book is written with grace and wit; again and again, Neiman writes the kind of sentences we dream of uttering in the perfect conversation: where every mot is bon. This is exemplary philosophy."<b>--Michael Walzer</b></p><p>"A brilliant study of changes in our understanding of evil from the book of Job through the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and on to the Holocaust and September 11. Neiman makes a powerful case for taking that problem as central to the history of modern philosophy, and her analysis of our present resources for coping with evil are provocative as well as profound. It's an immensely illuminating book."<b>--J. B. Schneewind</b></p><p>"In tracing the responses to the problem of evil from the Enlightenment, when the question was why the Lisbon earthquake and the engag�s were Voltaire, Leibniz, Pope, and Rousseau, to the present, when it is why Auschwitz and they are Am�ry, Arendt, Camus, and Adorno, Neiman has made an original and powerful contribution to the analysis of an intractable moral issue: how to live with the fact that neither God nor nature seems concerned with our fate. Succinctly, steadily, and relentlessly written, the history of philosophy as philosophy could hardly be better done."<b>--Clifford Geertz</b></p><p>"Even--or especially--to a nonphilosopher like myself, Susan Neiman's <i>Evil in Modern Thought</i> offers intellectual adventure of a high order. The audacity of her recasting of Western philosophy is matched by its profundity--and frequent wit. Its challenges are as bracing as they are essential. Her intellectual fearlessness deserves the closest and widest attention."<b>--Todd Gitlin</b></p><b>Susan Neiman</b> is Director of the Einstein Forum, Potsdam. Her previous works include <i>Slow Fire: Jewish Notes from Berlin</i> and <i>The Unity of Reason: Rereading Kant</i>.

In the midst of the Seven Years War(1758), at about age fifteen, Jemison was taken from her western Pennsylvania home by a Shawnee and French raiding party. Her family was killed, but Mary was traded to two Seneca sisters who adopted her to replace a slain brother. She lived to survive two Indian husbands, the births of eight children, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the canal era in upstate New York. In 1833 she died at about age ninety.</p></p><p>In 1758, fifteen-year-old Mary Jemison and her family were captured near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by a Shawnee and French raiding party. Shortly thereafter, her family was killed; she was turned over to a Seneca family, adopted by them, and four years later taken to their western New York homeland--where, by choice, she spent the rest of her life as an Iroquois wife, mother, and landed proprietor.<b>James E.

Between 1915, when they first began to write to each other, and 1946, when Stieglitz died, O'Keeffe and Stieglitz exchanged over 5,000 letters (more than 25,000 pages) that describe their daily lives in profoundly rich detail. This long-awaited volume features some 650 letters, carefully selected and annotated by leading photography scholar Sarah Greenough.</p><p>In O'Keeffe's sparse and vibrant style and Stieglitz's fervent and lyrical manner, the letters describe how they met and fell in love in the 1910s; how they carved out a life together in the 1920s; how their relationship nearly collapsed during the early years of the Depression; and how it was reconstructed in the late 1930s and early 1940s. At the same time, the correspondence reveals the creative evolution of their art and ideas; their friendships with many of the most influential figures in early American modernism (Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and Paul Strand, to name a few); and their relationships and conversations with an exceptionally wide range of key figures in American and European art and culture (including Duncan Phillips,&nbsp;Diego Rivera, D. H. Lawrence, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Marcel Duchamp).

This monumental book is the first general history of the Shakers from their origins in eighteenth-century England to the present day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Drawing on written and oral testimony by Shakers over the past two centuries, Stephen J. Stein offers a full and often revisionist account of the movement: their charismatic leaders, the early years in revolutionary New York and New England, the expansion into the West, the maturation and growth of the sect before the Civil War, the decline in their fortunes after the war, the painful adjustments to society Shakers had to make during the first half of the twentieth century, the renaissance of interest after 1950, and the &#x201c;forbidden topic&#x201d; within contemporary Shakerism&#x2015;the conflict between the two remaining villages at Canterbury, New Hampshire, and Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Stein provides many new interpretations of the Shaker experience. He reassesses the role of founder Ann Lee, emphasizes the impact of the western Shaker settlements on the course of the society&#x2019;s history, and describes the variety of cultural enterprises that have obscured the religious and historical dimensions of the Shakers. Throughout Stein places the Shaker experience within the wider context of American life and shows how the movement has evolved to deal with changing times. Shattering the romantic myth that has been perpetuated about the quaint and peaceful Shakers, Stein portrays a group that is factious, practical, and fully human.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen J.

It is common knowledge that in Western societies there have been periods of crisis when new science has threatened established religious authority. The trial of Galileo in 1633 and the uproar caused by Darwin&#39;s Origin of Species(1859) are two famous examples. Taking account of recent scholarship in the history of science, Professor Brooke takes a fresh look at these and similar episodes, showing that science and religion have been mutually relevant in such a rich variety of ways that simple generalizations are not possible. Standing back from general theses affirming &#34;conflict&#34; or &#34;harmony,&#34; which have so often served partisan interests, the author&#39;s object is to reveal the subtlety, complexity, and diversity of the interaction of science and religion as it has taken place in the past and in the twentieth century. Instead of treating science and religion as discrete definable entities, his approach is sensitive to shifting boundaries and willing to consider the contexts in which particular forms of science could be used both for religious and secular ends. The result is that, without assuming specialist knowledge, Brooke provides a wide-ranging study from the Copernican innovation to in vitro fertilization.</p><p>One of the most fascinating and enduring issues in the development of the modern world--the relationship between scientific thought and religious belief--is reviewed in the context of recent scholarship in the history of science.John Hedley Brooke is Professor of Science and Religion at the University of Oxford.</p><h2>The English godfather</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

The outstanding problem sets are a hallmark feature of this book. Provides clear, complete explanations to fully explain mathematical concepts. <b></b> Features subsections on the probabilistic method and the maximum-minimums identity. Includes many new examples relating to DNA matching, utility, finance, and applications of the probabilistic method. Features an intuitive treatment of probability&#x2014;intuitive explanations follow many examples. The <b>Probability Models Disk</b> included with each copy of the book, contains six probability models that are referenced in the book and allow readers to quickly and easily perform calculations and simulations. </p></p><p><p> "We see that the theory of probability is at bottom only common sense reduced to calculation; it makes us appreciate with exactitude what reasonable minds feel by a sort of instinct, often without being able to account for it .... It is remarkable that this science, which originated in the consideration of games of chance, should have become the most important object of human knowledge .... The most important questions of life are, for the most part, really only problems of probability." So said the famous French mathematician and astronomer (the "Newton of France") Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace. Although many people might feel that the famous marquis, who was also one of the great contributors to the development of probability, might have exaggerated somewhat, it is nevertheless true that probability theory has become a tool of fundamental importance to nearly all scientists, engineers, medical practitioners, jurists, and industrialists. In fact, the enlightened individual had learned to ask not "Is it so?" but rather "What is the probability that it is so?" </p> <p> This book is intended as an elementary introduction to the theory of probability for students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including computer science, the social sciences and management science) who possess the prerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus. It attempts to present not only the mathematics of probability theory, but also, through numerous examples, the many diverse possible applications of this subject. </p> <p> In Chapter 1 we present the basic principles of combinatorial analysis, which are most useful in computing probabilities. </p> <p> In Chapter 2 we consider the axioms of probability theory and show how they can be applied to compute various probabilities of interest. </p> <p> Chapter 3 deals with the extremely important subjects of conditional probability and independence of events. By a series of examples we illustrate how conditional probabilities come into play not only when some partial information is available, but also as a tool to enable us to compute probabilities more easily, even when no partial information is present. This extremely important technique of obtaining probabilities by "conditioning" reappears in Chapter 7, where we use it to obtain expectations. </p> <p> In Chapters 4, 5, and 6 we introduce the concept of random variables. Discrete random variables are dealt with in Chapter 4, continuous random variables in Chapter 5, and jointly distributed random variables in Chapter 6. The important concepts of the expected value and the variance of a random variable are introduced in Chapters 4 and 5: These quantities are then determined for many of the common types of random variables. </p> <p> Additional properties of the expected value are considered in Chapter 7. Many examples illustrating the usefulness of the result that the expected value of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their expected values are presented. Sections on conditional expectation, including its use in prediction, and moment generating functions are contained in this chapter. In addition, the final section introduces the multi-variate normal distribution and presents a simple proof concerning the joint distribution of the sample mean and sample variance of a sample from a normal distribution. </p> <p> In Chapter 8 we present the major theoretical results of probability theory. In particular, we prove the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Our proof of the strong law is a relatively simple one which assumes that the random variables have a finite fourth moment, and our proof of the central limit theorem assumes Levy's continuity theorem. Also in this chapter we present such probability inequalities as Markov's inequality, Chebyshev's inequality, and Chernoff bounds. The final section of Chapter 8 gives a bound on the error involved when a probability concerning a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables is approximated by the corresponding probability for a Poisson random variable having the same expected value. </p> <p> Chapter 9 presents some additional topics, such as Markov chains, the Poisson process, and an introduction to information and coding theory, and Chapter 10 considers simulation. </p> <p> The sixth edition continues the evolution and fine tuning of the text. There are many new exercises and examples. Among the latter are examples on utility (Example 4c of Chapter 4), on normal approximations (Example 4i of Chapter 5), on applying the lognormal distribution to finance (Example 3d of Chapter 6), and on coupon collecting with general collection probabilities (Example 2v of Chapter 7). There are also new optional subsections in Chapter 7 dealing with the probabilistic method (Subsection 7.2.1), and with the maximum-minimums identity (Subsection 7.2.2). </p> <p> As in the previous edition, three sets of exercises are given at the end of each chapter. They are designated as <b>Problems, Theoretical Exercises,</b> and <b>Self-Test Problems and Exercises.</b> This last set of exercises, for which complete solutions appear in Appendix B, is designed to help students test their comprehension and study for exams. </p> <p> All materials included on the Probability Models diskette from previous editions can now be downloaded from the Ross companion website at <b>http://www.prenhall.com/ross</b>. Using the website students will be able to perform calculations and simulations quickly and easily in six key areas: </p> <ul> <li>Three of the modules derive probabilities for, respectively, binomial, Poisson, and normal random variables.</li> <li>Another module illustrates the central limit theorem. It considers random variables that take on one of the values 0,1, 2, 3, 4 and allows the user to enter the probabilities for these values along with a number <i>n.</i> The module then plots the probability mass function of the sum of <i>n</i> independent random variables of this type. By increasing <i>n</i> one can "see" the mass function converge to the shape of a normal density function.</li> <li>The other two modules illustrate the strong law of large numbers. Again the user enters probabilities for the five possible values of the random variable along with an integer <i>n.</i> The program then uses random numbers to simulate <i>n</i> random variables having the prescribed distribution. The modules graph the number of times each outcome occurs along with the average of all outcomes. The modules differ in how they graph the results of the trials.</li> </ul></p><h2>National Aeronautics and Space Administration Graphics Standards Manual</h2><p><p>The <i>NASA Graphics Standards Manual</i>, by Richard Danne and Bruce Blackburn, is a futuristic vision for an agency at the cutting edge of science and exploration.

Arguing that not even the purest mathematics can be separated from its cultural background, Alexander shows how popular stories about mathematicians are really morality tales about their craft as it relates to the world. In the eighteenth century, Alexander says, mathematicians were idealized as child-like, eternally curious, and uniquely suited to reveal the hidden harmonies of the world. But in the nineteenth century, brilliant mathematicians like Galois became Romantic heroes like poets, artists, and musicians. The ideal mathematician was now an alienated loner, driven to despondency by an uncomprehending world. A field that had been focused on the natural world now sought to create its own reality. Higher mathematics became a world unto itself&#x2014;pure and governed solely by the laws of reason. In this strikingly original book that takes us from Paris to St. Petersburg, Norway to Transylvania, Alexander introduces us to national heroes and outcasts, innocents, swindlers, and martyrs&#x2013;all uncommonly gifted creators of modern mathematics.</p><p>Amir Alexander is a historian and writer in Los Angeles.<i>Duel at Dawn</i> is a delightful examination of the ways in which certain mathematicians have been made into mythical figures, and how the tropes of those canonical treatments have changed over the years. It's a fascinating and original book. (Peter Galison, author of <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps: Empires of Time</i>)<br><br>Does romantic mathematics exist? Romantic mathematicians do. <i>Duel at Dawn</i> reveals how the great mathematicians of the Enlightenment used geometry to study the earth and heavens, while their 19th century counterparts cherished internal beauty rather than practicality. Amir Alexander's original and convincing book opens a new path in the history of mathematics. (Jean-Michel Kantor, co-author of <i>Naming Infinity: A True Story of Religious Mysticism and Mathematical Creativity</i>)<br><br>Through the life stories of three of the period's most controversial figures, Evariste Galois, Niels Henrik Abel and Janos Bolyai, Alexander reveals how their transgressive work changed mathematics and led to their lionization as Romantic heroes...Duel at Dawn neither talks over the head of its readers nor condescends, but instead ensures that the work of these Romantic mathematicians is not cloaked in obscurity. Of particular note is his breakdown of Hungarian mathematician Janos Bolyai's discovery of non-Euclidian geometry. Alexander does not shy away from the intricacies of the theory, nor the drawn out, convoluted history that underlies it. He takes readers through the process step by step, using plain language and clear diagrams to chart a course through the unknown. The larger narrative remains coherent without these more technical chapters, thanks to Alexander's ability to weave much of the mathematics into the fascinating lives of his subjects, but these in-depth studies of the math behind the men is very enriching. Mathematics need not be a scary, daunting subject, and Alexander does much to prove it. (Michael Patrick Brady <i>Forbes.com</i> 2010-04-13)<br><br><i>Duel at Dawn</i> suggests how preconceptions about the trappings of genius have radiated from art to maths. But its greater value lies in peeling back the layers of hagiography from figures such as Galois to reveal gloriously complicated men. (Jascha Hoffman <i>Nature</i> 2010-04-15)<br><br>With tremendous attention to detail, historian Alexander examines the lives of 18th and 19th century mathematicians, finding much evidence to support his theory that the earlier geniuses of math (like �variste Galois and Neils Henrik Abel) cultivated an artistic temperament, living short but fiery lives with little recognition, while the next generation (Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Leonhard Euler) pursued mathematics (and life) with purity and rigor, becoming "successful men of affairs who were the bright stars of their era and lived to a ripe old age."...Alexander's personable history of mathematics over two centuries (rounded out by a brief look at the present and future of the field) is filled with biographical details that will interest devoted mathematicians and historians of math or science. (<i>Publishers Weekly online</i> 2010-04-19)<br><br>This is a fascinating and provocative book. It is also extremely readable: the accounts of Galois, Abel, Cauchy and Bolyai and their posthumous reputations are engaging and entertaining, and along the way we meet many other fascinating personalities, including Guglielmo Libri, the aristocratic revolutionary, mathematician and stealer of rare books. Alexander's arguments are illuminating. (Tony Mann <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2010-05-06)<br><br>Alexander sees Galois's death as a turning point in the history of modern mathematics, a point at which math became less a study of nature than a purely abstract realm of its own, uncontaminated by the external world. He skillfully tells the story of this change, weaving it around the often tragic lives of the mathematicians most responsible for the change...[A] marvelous history. (Martin Gardner <i>New Criterion</i> 2010-06-01)<br><br>Because it is such an engrossing story, it's easy to forget that the book's purpose also is to educate. Alexander conveys a general sense of who mathematicians were and how they fit in with society. (Leigh Arber <i>Bookslut</i> 2010-07-01)<br><br>Though the Romantic ethos has persisted for a surprisingly long time among mathematicians, Alexander suspects that a cultural change is even now underway: reliance upon computers is replacing the mathematician-as-tragic-hero with the mathematician-as-skillful-nerd. Fascinating human faces peer out at the reader from behind seemingly sterile formulas. (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist</i> 2010-04-15)<br><br>[Alexander's] sensitive and thoughtful presentation illuminates the inner geometry of mathematical experience, leaving us to ponder whether its creators' parallel lives and works finally meet.

More important, it's a book about selective breeding on a far, far grander scale&#x2015;a scale that encompasses all life on Earth. We'd call it evolution.</p><p>A unique fusion of art, science, and history, this book celebrates the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's monumental work <i>The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</i>, and is intended as a tribute to what Darwin might have achieved had he possessed that elusive missing piece to the evolutionary puzzle&#x2015;the knowledge of how individual traits are passed from one generation to the next. With the benefit of a century and a half of hindsight, Katrina van Grouw explains evolution by building on the analogy that Darwin himself used&#x2015;comparing the selective breeding process with natural selection in the wild, and, like Darwin, featuring a multitude of fascinating examples.</p><p>This is more than just a book about pets and livestock, however. The revelation of <i>Unnatural Selection </i>is that identical traits can occur in <i>all </i>animals, wild and domesticated, and both are governed by the same evolutionary principles. As van Grouw shows, animals are plastic things, constantly changing. In wild animals the changes are usually too slow to see&#x2015;species appear to stay the same. When it comes to domesticated animals, however, change happens fast, making them the perfect model of evolution in action.</p><p>Suitable for the lay reader and student, as well as the more seasoned biologist, and featuring more than four hundred breathtaking illustrations of living animals, skeletons, and historical specimens, <i>Unnatural Selection </i>will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in natural history and the history of evolutionary thinking.</p></p><p><p> "I'm impressed with this book's content, organization, and writing.

To find out, neuroscientist and bestselling author Gregory Berns and his team did something nobody had ever attempted: they trained dogs to go into an MRI scanner--completely awake--so they could figure out what they think and feel. And dogs were just the beginning. In <i>What It's Like to Be a Dog</i>, Berns takes us into the minds of wild animals: sea lions who can learn to dance, dolphins who can see with sound, and even the now extinct Tasmanian tiger. Berns's latest scientific breakthroughs prove definitively that animals have feelings very much like we do--a revelation that forces us to reconsider how we think about and treat animals.

That got my attention. But as I stood in a clearing of scrub trees in the hot, dry desert of South Sudan, I realized that the thin man walking toward me, leaning on a cane, was much more dangerous than any croc. Crocodiles attack when they are hungry or their turf or young are threatened. I was about to meet General Caesar Acellam, an African warlord who had helped lead a campaign of murder, rape, torture, and enslavement across at least four countries. He was a top lieutenant in the psychopath Joseph Kony&#x2019;s Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army. As such, Acellam had hunted the most vulnerable people on the planet&#x2014;poor, starving children&#x2014;to turn thousands of boys into sadistic soldiers and girls into sex slaves.<br> <br>It was May 2012, and the temperature was over one hundred degrees. I had flown into this remote camp in a Cessna Caravan turboprop just minutes before, and the sweat was pouring out of me. There were tents and Mi-8 transport helicopters and Mi-24 attack helicopters parked under camouflage tarps. The dirt landing strip and the camp clearing were barely visible when we began our descent. There was an unmistakable, almost electrical, charge of pride among the Ugandan army leaders who hosted us. For months their men had camped in the jungle and tracked and finally ambushed Acellam just a few days before along the banks of the River Mbou in the nearby Central African Republic (CAR)&#x2014;the same river where crocs had claimed their comrades.<br> <br>The LRA&#x2019;s evil campaign is more than a quarter century old. Its soldiers are vicious fighters with a twisted loyalty to the messianic Kony. He and the LRA are blamed for displacing around two million people and forcing upwards of sixty thousand children to fight for him during his more than two decades of spreading mayhem through what&#x2019;s called the Great Lakes region of Africa.1 At the time of my visit, Ugandan soldiers had been leading an effort to hunt the LRA down in CAR. Kony and his followers have been on the run and have lost many supporters in the last several years, but they are skilled jungle fighters and difficult to find.<br> <br>Kony has left a trail of death, mutilation, and misery. A young woman who looked to be about twenty also walked toward me with the forty-nine-year-old Acellam. The Ugandan commander explained that she was one of the thousands of girls Acellam and his followers had abducted and raped, and had been living as Acellam&#x2019;s &#x201c;wife.&#x201d; She was holding the hand of a little girl with an angelic face who looked to be about two years old: Acellam&#x2019;s daughter. The young woman&#x2019;s body language was striking. She clearly felt she had to stand near Acellam, yet she leaned away as if she were a magnet being repelled by a colliding charge. I fished in my pocket and produced a Tootsie Pop and handed it to the child. Her mother smiled at me and helped the little girl unwrap it.<br> <br>Acellam was being held under armed guards, but the Tootsie Pop was a weapon for my own personal mission that day. Others included my cameras, jars of peanut butter and jelly, and a few slices of bread. I am an experienced photographer of life in the developing world, both its fragile beauty and its dark, difficult sides. A friend of mine who is an advocate for impoverished and exploited people all over the world, and who supports the hunt for Kony, had asked me to take photographs of Acellam and his family. I was told that Acellam needed to look relaxed and smile in the photographs. Not for the sake of journalism or art: the photos were for laminated flyers urging the remaining members of the LRA to surrender. These would be dropped over the jungle by C-130 transport aircraft. It was important for the photograph to convey Acellam being treated well and with respect.<br> <br>Stiff and wary at first, his eyes bloodshot but still sharp, Acellam surveyed his surroundings as one experienced in dangerous situations would do. But there was a resignation to him. He was tired; he knew he was done. He was no longer in control of his fate. I reminded myself that I was in the presence of an evil predator. The good I hoped to accomplish with photographs required me to bury my disgust for a man who, at this moment, I needed to like me.<br> <br>Acellam, I could tell, was accustomed to underlings attending to his needs. I jumped up to get him water, and I prepared what for him was exotic fare: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. He liked it. He told me he and his family had been eating &#x201c;roots&#x201d; in the jungle. His English was very good. He began to relax. He smiled when I asked if he liked the peanut butter. I got the pictures, and over the next few months, 565,000 laminated flyers with my photographs of a smiling, apparently happy Acellam&#x2014;with quotes from him urging LRA fighters to surrender&#x2014;rained down over the jungles of the Central African Republic. In the year that followed, dozens of fighters and hundreds of victims emerged, including a barefoot, one-eyed combatant in a tattered suit who surrendered in Obo, CAR, by holding the flyer with the photographs of Acellam and his family over his head. He later explained that he had fought with Kony for sixteen years.<br><br><br> <br>This member of the Ugandan army was part of the brigade that captured General Caesar Acellam in May 2012. Photo: Howard G. Buffett<br><br><br> <br>The photographs used in this flyer represent a disarmed Acellam. They disproved rumors of his torture and death and encouraged many victims to seek out safety and escape Kony. Courtesy of: CLRA Partners<br><br>This was one of my more unusual high-adrenaline encounters in a decade of trying to attack the causes of hunger and create more sustainable, lasting solutions. It&#x2019;s been a wide-ranging journey, peppered with dangerous, even bizarre experiences. Why was a meeting with a vicious warlord part of the hunger equation? Because one of the most challenging elements in battling hunger, especially in Africa and Central America, is conflict. Individual stories of the bloodthirsty barbarism of Kony and his followers are horrifying, but two million people displaced and sixty thousand children kidnapped over the last twenty-plus years continue to live a fragile, hungry existence.<br> <br>Conflict is ugly and takes a long-lasting toll on children and families. It ruins agricultural production, disrupts the shipping of food, and destroys land. It creates mass dislocation as people flee for their lives. And that is a dislocation from which there is no easy or ready recovery. It can mean months, even years, spent in a filthy, crowded camp for displaced persons. It can mean returning home only to find that one&#x2019;s land and home have been taken over by others who feel entitled to remain there. And as those former child soldiers escape or are released from the only life they know&#x2014;uneducated, traumatized, disconnected from their families&#x2014;how are they to feed themselves? They have spent their childhoods murdering on command, often high on drugs. They typically have limited skills and are often hated by their own people.<br> <br>In 2005 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said that conflict was the world&#x2019;s leading cause of hunger.2 In 2007 Oxford University economist Paul Collier, writing in The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It, analyzed the states that are home to the world&#x2019;s poorest people, most of them in Africa. He found that 73 percent have recently been in, or continue to be in, a civil war. But poverty and hunger exacerbated by conflict exist all around the world. I&#x2019;ve seen firsthand the human toll the drug wars are taking in Central America. In some regions of Mexico, for example, families living in remote villages have been forced to convert their corn and bean crops to marijuana and are starving at the point of the drug lords&#x2019; guns.<br> <br>I confess: I am personally drawn to intense, high-stakes situations such as that South Sudan jungle. I am drawn to conflict-related challenges, as they are among the hardest problems we face. I am comfortable going where other philanthropists and aid groups may not or cannot go. But this kind of adventure is not my day job.<br> <br>As you&#x2019;re about to learn, I&#x2019;m a farmer. Mostly, I approach food insecurity&#x2014;when a person is routinely unsure of when, how, or where they will access their next meal&#x2014;and poverty from the perspective of a farmer who operates planters and combines and who understands soil, seeds, and fertilizer. The bulk of my battles are with weather, insects, and weeds. However, I&#x2019;m committed to addressing the full picture and complexity of hunger&#x2014;even the most difficult realities. And I can promise you that even in far less dramatic situations in agricultural agencies or food-security conferences or the back rooms of Washington, DC, there is a waste of resources, corruption, or unintended consequences from failed policies. These impediments and the slow pace of politics and bureaucracy are almost as maddening to me as a warlord&#x2019;s sneer. We know that millions of people die of nutrition- and hunger-related causes every year, more than three million of them children.3<br> <br>This mission did not come to me quickly or easily. To understand how I ended up making a warlord a sandwich, however, we have to leave the jungle and travel back in time to a much quieter spot in America&#x2019;s breadbasket.</p><h2>The Medieval Church: A Brief History</h2><p>The Church was the central institution of the European Middle Ages, and the foundation of medieval life.

The fourth trimester has more in common with the nine months that came before than with the lifetime that follows. This comprehensive, intimate, and much-needed &#x201c;operating manual&#x201d; for newborns presents a new paradigm of a baby's early life that shifts our focus and alters our priorities. <br><br>Combining the latest scientific findings with real-life stories and experiences, Susan Brink examines critical dimensions of newborn development such as eating and nutrition, bonding and attachment, sleep patterns, sensory development, pain and pleasure, and the creation of foundations for future advancement. Brink offers well-informed, practical information and the reasons behind her advice so that parents and caretakers can make their own decisions about how to care for a newborn during this crucial period. <i>The Fourth Trimester</i> assures readers that infants are as biologically capable as they are physically helpless. They thrive on what is readily available in every household: consistent, loving attention.</p><p>&#x201c;In this important work, Brink shows us something rare in the baby book world: an author that knows who parents are, what they need, what is supportive, and what is really good science.

Everywhere you turned, there were warnings about a widespread evil conspiracy to indoctrinate the vulnerable through the media they consumed. This percolating cultural hysteria, now known as the �&#x20ac;&#x153;Satanic Panic,�&#x20ac; not only sought to convince us of devils lurking behind the dials of our TVs and radios and the hellfire that awaited on book and video store shelves, it also created its own fascinating cultural legacy of Satan-battling VHS tapes, audio cassettes and literature. Satanic Panic: Pop-Cultural Paranoia in the 1980s offers an in-depth exploration of how a controversial culture war played out during the decade, from the publication of the memoir Michelle Remembers in 1980 to the end of the McMartin �&#x20ac;&#x153;Satanic Ritual Abuse�&#x20ac; Trial in 1990. <br><br>Satanic Panic features new essays and interviews by 20 writers who address the ways the widespread fear of a Satanic conspiracy was both illuminated and propagated through almost every pop culture pathway in the 1980s, from heavy metal music to Dungeons &amp; Dragons role playing games, Christian comics, direct-to-VHS scare films, pulp paperbacks, Saturday morning cartoons, TV talk shows and even home computers. The book also features case studies on Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth and Long Island �&#x20ac;&#x153;acid king�&#x20ac; killer Ricky Kasso. From con artists to pranksters and moralists to martyrs, the book captures the untold story of how the Satanic Panic was fought on the pop culture frontlines and the serious consequences it had for many involved.</p><p>KIER-LA JANISSE is the owner and Editor-in-Chief of Spectacular Optical, founder of The Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies and author of the books House of Psychotic Women: An Autobiographical Topography of Female Neurosis in Horror and Exploitation Films and A Violent Professional: The Films of Luciano Rossi, as well as co-editor of Spectacular Optical�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s first book, Kid Power!<br><br>Since 1999 Paul Corupe has shared his passion for Canada�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s film history at Canuxploitation.com, a site recognized as the essential source for uncovering the forgotten films of Canada�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s past.

Perhaps the seeds of liberty were planted in the 1735 historic courtroom battle for the freedom of the press. Or maybe the French and Indian War did it, when colonists were called "Americans" for the first time by the English, and the great English army proved itself not so formidable after all. But for sure when King George III started levying some heavy-handed taxes on the colonies, the break from the motherland was imminent. With such enthralling characters as George Washington, Sam Adams, Patrick Henry, Eliza Pinckney, and Alexander Hamilton throughout, <em>From Colonies to Country</em> is an amazing story of a nation-making transformation.</p><p>Joy Hakim is a former newspaper writer and editor and elementary school teacher who holds a bachelor&#39;s degree in government from Smith College and a master&#39;s degree in education from Goucher College.</p><h2>Walk Out Walk On: A Learning Journey into Communities Daring to Live the Future Now</h2><p><b>No One Is Coming to Help.

Explains the theories and experimental data behind the design procedures, and how to apply this information to real-world problems.Preface <p> Foundation Design: Principles and Practices is primarily intended for use as a textbook in undergraduate and graduate-level foundation engineering courses. It also serves well as a reference book for practicing engineers. As the title infers, this book covers both "principles" (the fundamentals of foundation engineering) and "practices" (the application of these principles to practical engineering problems). Readers should have already completed at least one university-level course in soil mechanics, and should have had at least an introduction to structural engineering. </p><p> This second edition contains many improvements and enhancements. These have been the result of comments and suggestions from those who used the first edition, my own experience using it at Cal Poly Pomona, and recent advances in the state-of-the-art. The chapters on deep foundations have been completely reorganized and rewritten, and new chapters on reliability-based design and sheet pile walls have been added. Extraneous material has been eliminated, and certain analysis methods have been clarified and simplified. The manuscript was extensively tested in the classroom before going to press. This classroom testing allowed me to evaluate and refine the text, the example problems, the homework problems, and the software. </p><p> Key features of this book include:</p><p>Integration with Geotechnical Engineering: Principles and Practices (Coduto, 1999), including consistent notation, terminology, analysis methods, and coordinated development of topics. However, readers who were introduced to geotechnical engineering using another text can easily transition to this book by reviewing the material in Chapters 3 and 4. Consideration of the geotechnical, structural, and construction engineering aspects of the design process, including emphasis on the roles of each discipline and the interrelationships between them. Frequent discussions of the sources and approximate magnitudes of uncertainties, along with comparisons of predicted and actual behavior. Use of both English and SI units, because engineers in North America and many other parts of the world need to be conversant in both systems. Integration of newly-developed Excel spreadsheets for foundation analysis and design. These spreadsheet files may be downloaded from the Prentice Hall website (prenhall/coduto). They are introduced only after the reader learns how to perform the analyses by manual computations. Extensive use of example problems, many of which are new to this edition. Inclusion of carefully developed homework problems distributed throughout the chapters, with comprehensive problems at the end of each chapter. Many of these problems are new or revised. Discussions of recent advances in foundation engineering, including Statnamic testing, load and resistance factor design (LRFD), and applications of the cone penetration test (CPT). Inclusion of extensive bibliographic references for those wishing to study certain topics in more detail. An instructor's manual is available to faculty. It may be obtained from your Prentice Hall campus representative. Acknowledgements </p><p> Many friends, colleagues, and other professionals contributed to this work.

In Jules Renard&#x2019;s world, plants and animals not only feel but speak (one species, the swallow, appears to write Hebrew), and yet, for all the anthropomorphic wit and whimsy the author indulges in, they guard their mystery too. Sly, funny, and touching, <i>Nature Stories</i>, here beautifully rendered into English by Douglas Parm�e and accompanied by the wonderful ink-brush images of Pierre Bonnard with which the book was originally published, is a literary classic of inexhaustible freshness.</p><p><p>Jules Renard (1864&#x2013;1910) was a French novelist, playwright, and diarist who divided his time between Paris and the Burgundian countryside for most of his life. He described his lonely childhood growing up in a cold bourgeois family in the autobiographical novel <i>Poil de carotte </i>(Carrot Top). Though educated to be a teacher, the young Renard moved to Paris where he took up with an actress of the Com�die-Fran�aise and was introduced<br> into the city&#x2019;s most prestigious literary salons. His marriage in 1888 to Marie Morneau brought him a large dowry and allowed him to devote himself to life as an <i>homme de lettres </i>and to found the literary review <i>Mercure de France</i>. For the rest of his short life Renard would spend the warmer months in Chitry, where like his father before him he became mayor. In Paris he lived the life of a member of the Acad�mie Goncourt and counted among his friends Alphonse Daudet, Edmond de Goncourt, Anatole France, Paul Claudel, and Sarah Bernhardt. In addition to <i>Poil de carotte </i>and <i>Histoires naturelles</i>, Renard is best known for his five-volume <i>Journal</i>, cited as an influence by authors as diverse as W. Somerset Maugham, Susan Sontag, Donald Barthelme, and Samuel Beckett. Among his other works are <i>Le plaisir de rompre</i>, <i>L&#x2019; �cornifleur</i>, and <i>Huit jours � la campagne</i>.<br> Douglas Parm�e (1914&#x2013;2008) was a lecturer in modern languages at Cambridge and a Lifetime Fellow of Queens&#x2019; College. He translated many works of classic and contemporary literature from French, Italian, and German, receiving the the Scott Moncrieff Prize for French translation in 1976. NYRB Classics publishes his translations of <i>The Child </i>by Jules Vall�s and <i>Afloat </i>by Guy de Maupassant and in 2011 will publish his translation of <i>Irretrievable </i>by Theodor Fontaine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) was among the most iconic and original Post-Impressionist French painters, and a founding member of the avant-garde group Les Nabis.</p>&#x201c;Renard&#x2019;s way with the detail is unforgettable. Renard writes about spiders, about the moon, and the poetry he makes from the things his eyes tell him is joyful.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Michael Silverblatt, <i>Bookworm</i><br> &#x201c;Renard&#x2019;s people&#x2014;and animals and plants, too&#x2014;are not reflections of Renard. They are not metaphors for his moods. They are not steps in his argument. They are as close as he can come to describing being someone or something not Renard. Renard&#x2019;s truthfulness is the truthfulness of a scrupulous, disinterested witness. You trust him as you trust a Quaker.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Naomi Bliven, <i>The New Yorker</i><br> &#x201c;directly, or indirectly, Renard is at the origin of contemporary literature.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jean-Paul Sartre<br><br>"There is no real equivalent for the French word esprit which is somewhere between and beyond humor and wit and which is essentially what these short commentaries on the bird and animal world display." &#x2014;Kirkus Reviews<br><br>&#x201c;The farmyard beasts, hunted game, insects and birds of the Ni�vre were world enough for him [Renard]. Sometimes their activities add up to a story, sometimes an extended observation; or they might just provide a joyful moment&#x2014;for instance, when a kingfisher comes and perches on his fishing-rod (&#x2018;I was swelling with pride at having been taken for a tree&#x2019;).

On what date do the dog days begin? What is Hansel Monday? How do Chinese, Muslim, Mesoamerican, Jewish, and Babylonian calendars differ from Christian calendars? The answers to these and hundreds of other intriguing questions about the way humans have marked and measured time over the millennia can be found in <em>The Oxford Companion to the Year</em>.<br> The desire to set aside certain periods of time to mark their significance is a transhistorical, transcultural phenomena. Virtually all cultures have marked special days or periods: the feast day of a saint, the celebration of a historical event, the turning of a season, a period of fasting, the birthday of an important historical figure. Around these days a rich body of traditions, beliefs, and superstitions have grown up, many of them only half-remembered today. Now, for the first time, Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens combine this body of knowledge with a wide-ranging survey of calendars across cultures in an authoritative and engaging one-volume reference work. The first section of <em>The Oxford Companion to the Year</em> is a day-by-day survey of the calendar year, revealing the history, literature, legend, and lore associated with each season, month, and day. The second part provides a broader study of time-reckoning: historical and modern calendars, religious and civil, are explained, with handy tables for the conversion of dates between various systems and a helpful index to facilitate speedy reference.<br> <em>The Oxford Companion to the Year</em> is a unique and uniquely delightful reference source, an indispensable aid for all historians and antiquarians, and a rich mine of information and inspiration for browsers.<br></p><p><i>The Oxford Companion to the Year</i> is one of those splendid volumes that should have a permanent place in every personal reference library, next to a well-thumbed <i>Brewer's</i>.<p> The main body of the book gives a huge amount of historical and folkloric information on every day of the year (including, yes, February 30, which has happened three times); the days of the week, months and seasons; and the major feast days and festivals in a wide variety of different cultures. This is the section that most readers will find the most fascinating; its 658 pages provide endless browsing.</p><p> The second part concentrates on the making of calendars over the centuries: how our own complex calendar evolved with its irregular month lengths and its rules for when leap years occur, plus details of the calendars of many other cultures--Chinese, Hindu, Muslim, and many more--all trying to find a regular system that can cope with the fact that the roughly 29-and-one-half-day lunar month and the roughly 365-and-one-quarter-day solar year simply can't be meshed.</p><p> Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens must be congratulated on the huge amount of work this book must have taken, and on such splendid results. <i>--David V.

Conventional histories have understood Christianity as a religion that from its beginnings sought to transcend ethnic and racial distinctions. Denise Kimber Buell challenges this view by revealing the centrality of ethnicity and race in early definitions of Christianity. Buell&#39;s readings of various texts consider the use of &#34;ethnic reasoning&#34; to depict Christianness as more than a set of shared religious practices and beliefs. By asking themselves, &#34;Why this new race&#34; Christians positioned themselves as members of an ethnos or genos distinct from Jews, Romans, and Greeks. Buell focuses on texts written before Christianity became legal in 313 C.E., including Greek apologetic treatises, martyr narratives, and works by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian. Philosophers and theologians used ethnic reasoning to define Christians as a distinct people within classical and ancient Near East society and in intra-Christian debates about what constituted Christianness. Many characterized Christianness as both fixed and fluid-it had a real essence (fixed) but could be acquired through conversion (fluid). Buell demonstrates how this dynamic view of race and ethnicity allowed Christians to establish boundaries around the meaning of Christianness and to develop universalizing claims that all should join the Christian people. In addressing questions of historiography, Buell analyzes why generations of scholars have refused to acknowledge ethnic reasoning in early Christian discourses. Moreover, Buell&#39;s arguments about the importance of ethnicity and religion in early Christianity provide insights into the historical legacy of Christian anti-Semitism as well as contemporary issues of race.</p><p><p>Denise Kimber Buell is professor of religion at Williams College and the author of <i>Making Christians: Clement of Alexandria and the Rhetoric of Legitimacy</i>.</p> (2/2006)<br><br><p>Denise Kimber Buell is associate professor of religion at Williams College.

But behind this significant triumph is a thrilling story, one that has thus far eluded both historians and surveyors. In this engrossing narrative, professional surveyor Edwin Danson takes us on a fascinating journey with Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two gifted and exuberant English surveyors, through the fields and forests of eighteenth-century America. Vividly describing life in the backwoods and the hardships and dangers of frontier surveying, Drawing the Line discloses for the first time in 250 years many hitherto unknown surveying methods, revealing how Mason and Dixon succeeded where the best American surveyors of the period failed. In accessible, ordinary language, Danson masterfully throws the first clear light on the surveying of the Mason-Dixon line. Set in the social and historical context of pre-Revolutionary America, this book is a spellbinding account of one of the great and historic achievements of its time.<br> <br> Advance Praise for Drawing the Line<br> <br> "Drawing the Line combines a fast-moving story, a human drama, and a clear account of surveying in the era of George Washington. An intriguing interaction of politics and science."-CHARLES ROYSTER, Boyd Professor of History, Louisiana State University, and Winner of the Bancroft Prize in History</p><p>"Made famous as line between free and slave states before War Between the States. The survey establishing Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary began in 1763; halted by Indian wars 1767; continued to southwest corner 1782: marked 1784." <p>Behind these words, inscribed on a solitary monument in southwest Pennsylvania, lies the complex, compelling tale of the most famous surveyors&#x2019; line ever drawn. Originally created to settle an eighty-year border dispute between two aristocratic colonial families, the Mason-Dixon line not only became one of the greatest scientific achievements of its time but, nearly a century later, came to mark the monumental boundary between free and slave states.</p> <p>In the first nonfiction chronicle of this ambitious undertaking, professional surveyor Edwin Danson takes us on a grand tour through a world now mostly lost to us. Drawing the Line reconstructs the making of the Mason-Dixon line, from the infamous quarrels between the patrician Baltimore family of Maryland and the powerful Penn family of Pennsylvania to the harrowing fields and forests of eighteenth-century America, where we accompany Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two young, exuberant English surveyors, as they risk their lives to resolve the epic border feud and establish a precise survey that had begun to seem "impossible for the Art of Man."</p> <p>After five grueling years in which the two intrepid Englishmen faced heavy rains and freezing sleet, along with angry Indians, they finally completed their assignment. Their great boundary survey was the first and, for many years, the most ambitious geodetic survey ever conducted. It set a precedent for the precise measurement and mapping of vast land distances. In addition to surveying 325 miles of boundary lines, Mason and Dixon measured the first degree of latitude and took the first scientific gravity measurements ever recorded in America.</p> <p>In ordinary language, Danson introduces us to the fascinating science of surveying, revealing for the first time in 250 years many long-lost surveying methods and finally answering the question of how Mason and Dixon succeeded where the best American surveyors had failed. Weaving revelations about surveying into an engrossing historical narrative that captures the spirit of pre-Revolutionary America, this book accomplishes for the making of the Mason-Dixon line what Dava Sobel&#x2019;s Longitude did for John Harrison and the science of time measurement.</p> <p>Exhaustively researched and vividly written, Drawing the Line presents a brilliant exploration of how two men solved one of the most formidable problems of eighteenth-century America&#x2013;and revolutionized the way we have come to map America&#x2019;s grand landscape.</p>EDWIN DANSON is a geodetic surveyor with some 35 years of experience working on assignments in many countries, including the United States. He is a Chartered Surveyor of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors. He has made many contributions to professional journals and books and is a prominent authority in his field. He lives near London, England.</p><h2>Choosing Thankfulness (First Place Bible Study)</h2><p>Bible Studies Health - Food</p><p></p><h2>Developmental Play Therapy in Clinical Social Work</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Covers all aspects of play therapy with children in mental health clinics, schools, health settings, private practice offices, and child and family service agencies. <b> </b> This book draws on classic and current materials in developing a theoretically-framed, dynamic assessment and intervention model of clinical social work with children and their parents.

And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

At first we simply got him the Pre-K workbook, and he went through that. We started homeschooling him at 4, and bought one of the textbooks in math that the local public schools uses and created all the other curriculum by hand. This book has been WONDERFUL for adding extra practice to everything we've been working on for "Kindergarten". It's colorful and about half way through the Kindergarten workbook my son had learned how to read the directions so he was able to use it as an independent workbook. This allowed him to practice his letters, numbers, etc for "fun" anytime he felt the urge. I would definitely recommend this to other homeschooling parents or traditional schooling parents who notice that there kids need a little extra help and practice.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong></p> <p>School Zone Website</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Review 2:</strong></p> <p>My son was having a hard time in preschool.

This handsome volume offers the first sustained examination of her early career from 1948&#x2013;78, which spans the art worlds of Havana, Paris, and New York. Essays consider the artist&#x2019;s early studies in Cuba, her involvement with the Salon des R�alit�s Nouvelles in post-war Paris, and her groundbreaking New York output, as well as situate her work in the context of a broader Latin American avant-garde art. An essay by Dana Miller considers Herrera&#x2019;s New York work of the 1950s through the 1970s, when Herrera was arriving at and perfecting her signature style of hard edge abstraction. Personal family photographs from Herrera&#x2019;s archive enrich the narrative, and a chronology addressing the entirety of her life and career features additional documentary images. Over 80 works are illustrated as color plates, making this book the most extensive representation of Herrera&#x2019;s work to date.</p><p>The life and work of contemporary artist Carmen Herrera is given a comprehensive look in this important, timely book.&nbsp;<br><b>Dana Miller</b> is Richard DeMartini Family Curator and Director of the Collection at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. <b>Serge Lemoine</b> is an art historian and professor emeritus at the Paris IV&#x2013;Sorbonne University and the former director of the Mus�e de Grenoble and former president of the Mus�e d&#x2019;Orsay in Paris. <b>Gerardo Mosquera</b> is a curator, critic, art historian, and writer based in Havana, Cuba. <b>Edward J.

Wolves and grandmothers, ugly sisters, a house made of bread, a goose made of gold...the folk tales collected by the Grimm brothers created an astonishingly influential imaginative world. However, this is also a world where a woman serves her stepson up in a stew, a man marries a snake, a princess sleeps with a frog, and an evil queen dances to death in a pair of burning shoes. Violent, funny, disturbing, wise and sometimes beautiful, these stories have intrigued children, adults, scholars, psychologists and artists for centuries. The only complete edition available of the most famous collection of fairy tales ever published, this collection features the 279 stories in an acclaimed, modern, unexpurgated translation.</p><p>Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859) were born in Hanau, Germany. They published the first of their many collections of fairy tales in 1812. The story that they wandered about Germany collecting their tales from the lips of peasants is a fairy tale itself. In fact, they invited educated middle class women into their home to tell them the stories they had heard from their servants. The point of their collection of folklore was to study the German language and they also did important work on the German dictionary. The stories were revised to be more appropriate for children in 1819 and were published under the title Children&#39;s and Household Tales.

Touching and wonderfully detailed, this portrait of French life in the 1890s will make readers feel not only that they know the time and place but that they are actually there. Fran�ois Seurel, a schoolmaster's son, is 15 and lives in a small village with his parents. Augustin Meaulnes is new at school, and comes to stay with the Seurel family as a boarder. Augustin is two years older and very charismatic, and the boys at the school start to call him le grand Meaulnes as a tribute. Jasmin Delouche, a physically small young man who nonetheless is cock of the walk at the school, feels supplanted by the new arrival&#x2014;but for Fran�ois, a whole new world of adventure has been opened. When the boys' ramblings lead them to the domain of the title and an odd party that is taking place there, events are set in motion that will change them. If this were only a chronicle of smalltown life and the ups and downs of youth, it would be a fine story, but the complications that force the boys to grow up quickly deepen the book and make it a classic.

It also is a useful reference for engineers interested in reviewing the basic principles of engineering economy. Used by engineering students worldwide, this best-selling text provides a sound understanding of the principles, basic concepts, and methodology of engineering economy. Built upon the rich and time-tested teaching materials of earlier editions, it is extensively revised and updated to reflect current trends and issues, with an emphasis on the economics of engineering design throughout. It provides one of the most complete and up-to-date studies of this vitally important field.</p><p><p>Engineering Economy Fifteenth Edition</p> <p>William G. Sullivan Elin M. Wicks C. Patrick Koelling</p> <p>A succinct job description for an engineer consists of two words: <em>problem solver</em>. Broadly speaking, engineers use knowledge to find new ways of doing things economically. Engineering design solutions do not exist in a vacuum but within the context of a business opportunity. Given that every problem has multiple solutions, the issue is: How does one rationally select the design with the most favorable economic result? The answer to this question can also be put forth in two words: <em>engineering economy</em>. Engineering economy provides a systematic framework for evaluating the economic aspects of competing design solutions. Just as engineers model the stress on a support column, or the thermodynamic response of a steam turbine, they must also model the economic impact of their recommendations. Engineering economy is the subject of this textbook.</p> <p>Highlights of <em>Engineering Economy</em>, Fifteenth Edition:</p> <ol> <li>Numerous green engineering examples and problems are new to this edition. Many incorporate energy conservation in commonly experienced situations. These elements pertain to engineering economy problems involving energy conservation, materials substitution, recycling, and other green situations.

This tendency can be found in practices and projects ranging from El Lissitzky's exhibition designs to Allan Kaprow's happenings, from minimalist objects to installation art. More recently, this kind of participatory art has gone so far as to encourage and produce new social relationships. Guy Debord's celebrated argument that capitalism fragments the social bond has become the premise for much relational art seeking to challenge and provide alternatives to the discontents of contemporary life. This publication collects texts that place this artistic development in historical and theoretical context. </p><p><i>Participation</i> begins with writings that provide a theoretical framework for relational art, with essays by Umberto Eco, Bertolt Brecht, Roland Barthes, Peter B�rger, Jen-Luc Nancy, Edoaurd Glissant, and F�lix Guattari, as well as the first translation into English of Jacques Ranci�re's influential "Problems and Transformations in Critical Art." The book also includes central writings by such artists as Lygia Clark and H�lio Oiticica, Joseph Beuys, Augusto Boal, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Thomas Hirschhorn, and Rirkrit Tiravanija.

"What if they were skillful enough to navigate on the outer surface of our air, and from there, through their curiosity to see us, they angled for us like fish? Would that please you?" asks the philosopher. "Why not?" the Marquise replies. "As for me, I'd put myself into their nets of my own volition just to have the pleasure of seeing those who caught me."<br><br>In this imaginary conversation of three hundred years ago, readers can share the excitement of a new, extremely daring view of the uinverse. <i>Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (Entretiens sur la pluralit� des mondes),</i> first published in 1686, is one of the best loved classics of the early French enlightenment. Through a series of informal dialogues that take place on successive evenings in the marquise's moonlit gardens, Fontenelle describes the new cosmology of the Copernican world view with matchles clarity, imagination, and wit. Moreover, he boldly makes his interlocutor a woman, inviting female participation in the almost exclusively male province of scientific discourse. <br><br>The popular Fontenelle lived through an entire century, from 1657 to 1757, and wrote prolifically. H. A. Hargreaves's fresh, appealing translation brings the author's masterpiece to new generations of readers, while the introduction by Nina Rattner Gelbart clearly demonstrates the importance of the <i>Conversations</i> for the history of science, of women, of literature, and of French civilization, and for the popularization of culture.</p><p><b>H. A. Hargreaves</b> is Professor of English at the University of Alberta. His interests range from Shakespeare to science fiction, and he is himself a cutural popularizer, having written as many stories, scripts, and documentaries as he has scholarly articles. <b>Nina Rattner Gelbart</b> is Professor of History at Occidental College, Los Angeles. She has written on Englightenment science, medicine, and utopian novels, and is the author of the prizewinning <i>The King's Midwife: A History and Mystery of Madame du Coudray</i> (California, 1998).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Spirit of Laws: A Compendium of the First English Edition</h2><p>Montesquieu's <i>The Spirit of Laws</i> is an enduring classic of social and political theory deserving a fresh reading every generation. The modern reader, however, is likely to find a work that ran to over a thousand pages in its two-volume first edition a bit overwhelming. Presented here, therefore, is the first English-language compendium of <i>The Spirit of Laws,</i> together with the first English translation of the posthumously published treatise containing the physiological theory underlying Montesquieu's theory of climate.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The IVP Women&#39;s Bible Commentary</h2><p>What does the Bible say to a young mother at home nursing her baby? What role models for intelligent, talented women can we find in Scripture? What was everyday life like for women in biblical times? What does Scripture say to women who have been abused or raped? What can men learn from women by viewing Scripture through their concerns and insights? This surprising commentary searches Scripture in light of the many theological, biblical, sociological and psychological concerns of women. Led by editors Catherine Clark Kroeger and Mary J. Evans, an international team of contributors offers thoughtful, engaging insight to complement more traditional approaches that have viewed Scripture primarily through the experiences and understanding of men. Fresh, practical and helpful, the <em>IVP Women's Bible Commentary</em> shows how relevant Scripture is to the legitimate concerns of men and women alike--and just how transforming God's Word can be when viewed from unaccustomed perspective. This reference work will be welcomed by pastors developing sermons, by Bible study teachers and leaders preparing lessons, by college and seminary students researching study assignments, and by individual readers who want to broaden their understanding of the richness of biblical revelation.</p><p>Catherine Clark Kroeger is adjunct associate professor of classical and ministry studies at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and coeditor (with James Beck) of Women, Abuse and the Bible and Healing the Hurting. Mary J. Evans teaches Old Testament at London Bible College and is the author of Woman in the Bible and 1 and 2 Samuel in the New International Bible Commentary.Some 88 women and men from around the world here provide commentary on most passages of the 66 books of the Protestant Bible, focusing on the meaning behind biblical gender interpretations. Designed to complement rather than supplement traditional biblical commentaries, their contributions are enhanced by 77 brief articles and 50-plus illustrations, tables, and more, all of which provide insight into biblical times and customs. Most of the commentary and brief articles include a basic bibliography, and both a scriptural and a supplementary article index enhance the volume. The inclusion of more Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox scholarship and full commentary instead of just an article on intertestamental history and literature would have increased the comprehensiveness and scope of this book, but it is nevertheless an admirable and very useful volume for lay people, clergy, and even biblical scholars. It is also the only commentary available with this specific focus; Women in Scripture: A Dictionary of Named and Unnamed Women in the Hebrew Bible, the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books, and the New Testament is differently organized and comments on the women rather than on the biblical passages.

Throughout, clearly defined demonstrations provide easy access to the practice of drawing as well as the history and development of core drawing techniques. Richly illustrated, the book contains reproductions of the finest master drawings from the fifteenth century to the present. Unlike other drawing instruction books that focus on step-by-step lessons exclusively, <i>Foundations of Drawing </i>provides readers with the context and background to help understand just why these materials and methods are so vital for successful drawing.</p></p><p>AL GURY chairs the painting department at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he also teaches drawing. Gury exhibits his work at the F.A.N. Gallery and has shown at the National Academy of Design in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and numerous other galleries and museums around the country. He is the author of <i>Alla Prima: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Direct Painting</i> and <i>Color for Painters: A Guide to Traditions and Practice</i>. He lives in Philadelphia, PA.<b>INTRODUCTION<br></b><br> <i>Foundations of Drawing </i>is a guide for teachers, students, artists, and the general reader to the traditions and practice of drawing in Western culture. This overview of the history of drawing and of drawing materials, concepts, and techniques provides a practical look at the art of drawing and will be a useful text for anyone who is interested in learning about drawing, returning to drawing, studying drawing, or teaching drawing as well as for longtime practitioners of the art. The book takes the point of view that clear information on the history, materials, and techniques of drawing creates the ability to understand drawing, make choices, and chart one&#x2019;s development in drawing with a sense of confidence.<br><br> <i>Foundations of Drawing </i>focuses on classic drawing mediums such as pencil and charcoal while also presenting an overview of a broad range of other materials, including chalk and oil pastels, watercolors, and acrylics. Not all materials are discussed in depth, but the essential ones are presented. Traditional materials and methods are illustrated through examples of old master and contemporary drawings as well as through demonstrations of basic concepts. The essential elements and concepts of core drawing genres&#x2014;still life, interiors, portraiture, life drawing, and landscape&#x2014;are presented for foundational drawing study and portfolio-making. More experienced artists can use <i>Foundations of Drawing </i>as a sourcebook and a point of departure for further personal growth and artistic exploration.&nbsp;<br><br> Drawing is an essential part of a portfolio for art school admittance. Drawing shows whether or not the applicant has a basic ability to understand visual organization and use the formal principals of shape, form, line, light, and perspective. It also shows whether or not the applicant can visualize creative ideas and concepts.&nbsp;<br><b><br>What Is Drawing?<br></b><br> For many centuries, drawing has been a practical approach to visualizing and planning everything from human figures in an oil painting to designing machine parts, buildings, and textiles. Simple materials such as graphite&nbsp;pencils, charcoal, and ink have been the primary means for doing the great majority of drawings.<br><br>The term <i>drawing </i>now encompasses a wide range of traditional and nontraditional mediums, approaches, and aesthetics. Modern technology has created new versions of old materials and has sometimes even replaced them. For example, fine-point marker pens have added to or replaced older dip pens and ink bottles for some artists. Some artists rely on and cherish traditional materials and methods, while others draw only on computer screens. And some artists draw experimentally using materials their Renaissance ancestors would think very strange: blood, tar, food, and computer drawing pads.<br><br> Also, the aesthetics of drawing, which traditionally focused on a figure, an object, or a scene, now include abstract and conceptual forms having little to do with nature and more to do with how the artist personally interprets the world. Once thought of as the province of trained artists or skilled amateurs, drawing is now recognized as part of the language of children, the mentally disabled, and self-taught or outsider artists. Prisoners and victims of social injustice draw in order to document their social and political experiences.</p><h2>Elementary Linear Algebra: Applications Version</h2><p><i>Elementary Linear Algebra</i> 10th edition gives an elementary treatment of linear algebra that is suitable for a first course for undergraduate students. The aim is to present the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible way; pedagogy is the main consideration. Calculus is not a prerequisite, but there are clearly labeled exercises and examples (which can be omitted without loss of continuity) for students who have studied calculus. Technology also is not required, but for those who would like to use MATLAB, Maple, or Mathematica, or calculators with linear algebra capabilities, exercises are included at the ends of chapters that allow for further exploration using those tools. <p>A concluding chapter covers twenty applications of linear algebra drawn from business, economics, physics, computer science, ecology, genetics, and other disciplines.

Separate chapters collectively treat minor masters and certain geographic and style groupings (e.g., Russian, Spanish, "nontonal" composers).

Gregg's poems oscillate between hushed reminiscence and savage whispers, always seeming to originate deep within a closely studied self: You walk... with your life inside you. The poems travel the globe, set in New England, California, Mexico, Greece and beyond, though wherever her poems go, Gregg never forgets that if paradise is to be here/ it will have to include her. Gregg offers up poems of love lost and won, and of an average life lived with extraordinary force, as high art, honing in on little tragedies that lead inexorably to the big one, Death, which more often than not arrives personified: When death comes, we take off our clothes. The poems always rejoice, however dark their subjects, in a powerful sense of simply being alive, and at times beauty and happiness break through in moments of stillness and solitude: It is summer and I am in the middle/ of my life.

The bizarre details of several of these stories offer much to recommend.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Literary Hub</i></b></p><h2>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</h2><p><p><strong>Nabokov's first novel in English, one of his greatest and most overlooked</strong></p><em>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</em>, Nabokov's first novel in English, was completed in Paris in 1938, first published by New Directions in 1941, reissued in 1959 to wide critical acclaim, and now relaunched again with an appreciative introduction by Pulitzer-Prize winning critic Michael Dirda. This, the narrator tells us, is the real life of famous author Sebastian Knight, the inside story. After Knight's death, his half-brother sets out to penetrate the mystery of the famous English novelist's life, but he is impeded by the false, the distorted, the irreverent. Yet the search proves to be a story quite as intriguing as any of Sebastian Knight's own books, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding. On one level, this literary detective story has pungent points to make about the role of the artist in a society basically hostile to the creative spirit. On another, <em>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</em> probes the essential problem of the ambiguity of human identity: Just who was Sebastian Knight?</p><p>"I am very happy that you liked that little book," wrote Vladimir Nabokov to Edmund Wilson in 1941. "As I think I told you, I wrote it five years ago, in Paris, on the implement called <i>bidet</i> as a writing desk--because we lived in one room and I had to use our small bathroom as a study." The book in question was <i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</i>. And despite its humble origins, Nabokov's first novel in English showed him to be in absolute command of his adopted language.<p> Like many of the author's later triumphs, this one revolves around a question of identity. The late Sebastian Knight, we discover, was a transplanted Russian novelist whose taste for linguistic trickery bears a certain resemblance to Nabokov's. Now his half-brother is attempting to reconstruct the existence of this elusive figure. As he readily admits, the raw material isn't exactly the stuff of melodrama: "Sebastian's life, though far from being dull, lacked the terrific vigour of his literary style." But even the most mundane facts prove difficult for the narrator to nail down. He does, on the other hand, describe Sebastian's creative processes in exquisite and accurate detail: </p><blockquote> His struggle with words was usually painful and this for two reasons. One was the common one with writers of his type: the bridging of the abyss lying between expression and thought; the maddening feeling that the right words, the only words are awaiting you on the opposite bank in the misty distance, and the shudderings of the still unclothed thought clamouring for them on this side of the abyss. </blockquote> Sebastian's real life--or anybody's, for that matter--refuses to yield up a verbal equivalent. Still, the narrator manages a kind of fraternal fusion with his subject on the book's final page, which suggests a fluid and very Nabokovian view of identity itself. For this reason, and for the splendors of its prose, <i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</i> is a necessary read. It's also safe to say that it's the very best novel ever written on a bidet. <i>--James Marcus</i>"Nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written, that is, ecstatically." -- John Updike <br>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is a perversely magical literary detective story -- subtle, intricate, leading to a tantalizing climax -- about the mysterious life of a famous writer. Many people knew things about Sebastian Knight as a distinguished novelist, but probably fewer than a dozen knew of the two love affairs that so profoundly influenced his career, the second one in such a disastrous way. After Knight's death, his half brother sets out to penetrate the enigma of his life, starting with a few scanty clues in the novelist's private papers. His search proves to be a story as intriguing as any of his subject's own novels, as baffling, and, in the end, as uniquely rewarding.</p><h2>Travesties</h2><p><i>Travesties</i> was born out of Stoppard's noting that in 1917 three of the twentieth century's most crucial revolutionaries -- James Joyce, the Dadaist founder Tristan Tzara, and Lenin -- were all living in Zurich. Also living in Zurich at this time was a British consula official called Henry Carr, a man acquainted with Joyce through the theater and later through a lawsuit concerning a pair of trousers. Taking Carr as his core, Stoppard spins this historical coincidence into a masterful and riotously funny play, a speculative portrait of what could have been the meeting of these profoundly influential men in a germinal Europe as seen through the lucid, lurid, faulty, and wholy riveting memory of an aging Henry Carr.</p><p>Tom Stoppard is the author of such seminal works as <i>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead, Travesties, Every Good Boy Deserves a Favor, Arcadia, Jumpers, The Real Thing, </i>and <i>The Invention of Love</i>.<b>Praise for <i>Travesties</i>:</b><p> &#x201c;Mind-bending splendor . . . a prismatic text . . .

See it this way&#x2014;if you can be right on average 70% of the time over the long term, you aren&#x2019;t just a great investor, you are a living legend. But that means being wrong 30% of the time. Your aim should be to understand you will make errors, while trying to avoid the commonest mistakes many (if not most) investors make. That can help you improve your long-term results. And <i>Debunkery</i> can show you how. <p></p> <b>It seems like everyone is so down on the stock market right now. What made you want to write a book about investing now?</b><br> There&#x2019;s a social tendency, easily documented, following all bear markets to continue to think all the problems newly emerged and envisioned in the previous bear market mean stocks can&#x2019;t ever rise again&#x2014;or at least not for a long, long time, usually defined as &#x201c;the next decade.&#x201d; Usually, folks then think we&#x2019;re in a period where &#x201c;it&#x2019;s different this time&#x201d;&#x2014;Sir John Templeton&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;four most dangerous words in investing.&#x201d; Actually, this concept is normal after every big bear market, and not &#x201c;different this time&#x201d; at all. <p></p> The bigger the bear market, the more people are likely to remain dour and fearful for a long time afterward. And fear particularly makes people turn to the safety of &#x201c;common wisdom&#x201d; or follow those rules of thumb that &#x201c;everyone knows.&#x201d; Of course, it&#x2019;s often &#x201c;wisdom <i>du jour</i>.&#x201d; But in <i>Debunkery</i>, I show that very often &#x201c;common wisdom&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t so wise and is in fact a harmful myth. Doing debunkery helps you see more clearly what the harmful myths are so you can better avoid making long-term costly errors. <p></p> <b>Many people worry now that consumers won&#x2019;t spend enough to help the economy recover, but you say consumers aren&#x2019;t as important to GDP as people think. Is that right?</b><br> This is an easy one to see right with debunkery because a lot of data exists around GDP and consumer spending. Consumer spending is over 70% of GDP&#x2014;so it is very important! But consumer spending is also very stable&#x2014;almost infinitely more so than people believe. It doesn&#x2019;t fall much during recessions, so it needn&#x2019;t come roaring back. I walk through the history of this in <i>Debunkery</i>. <p></p> Most of what we buy is boring&#x2014;toothpaste, health care services, rent, etc. We keep doing that even in bad times. The biggest part of spending is services&#x2014;which is huge and relatively stable. The smallest part of consumer spending are the big ticket, discretionary items you read about in headlines&#x2014;like cars, appliances, vacations. And spending on those things does fall in recessions, but more stable spending on services and staples simply swamps falling spending on more discretionary items. In fact, in the last five recessions, consumer spending as a percent of GDP actually <i>jumped</i>, because consumer spending remained relatively stable while other parts of the economy&#x2014;like trade and business spending&#x2014;fell much more. Consumer spending doesn&#x2019;t fall much, so it doesn&#x2019;t have to bounce much. You can see that easily with <i>Debunkery</i>. <p></p> <b> Amazingly, you also say stocks can and should rise on high unemployment. Is that right?</b><br> Almost everyone gets this wrong, even though vast amounts of data are publicly available going back a long way, as I show in <i>Debunkery</i>. In every single recession since 1929, unemployment stays high and rises even after the recession ends. And stocks rise <i>before</i> recessions end&#x2014;almost always&#x2014;basic rule. Stocks lead the economy by a good notch, jobs lag by a huge notch. <p></p> This seems counterintuitive but isn&#x2019;t. Think like a CEO would. You don&#x2019;t want to hire <i>before</i> sales and profitability have recovered. You want to hire after you are confident you see a clear pick-up. And sales and profitability don&#x2019;t recover clearly until the economic recovery gets underway. Plus, you probably had productivity gains through the recession, thanks to cost-cutting and just simply figuring out how to do more with less because you had to&#x2014;so you may be able to handle increasing sales with a smaller staff. Then too, the unemployment number is wonky&#x2014;it&#x2019;s perfectly normal to see rising payrolls alongside rising or plateauing unemployment as people who had given up on their job search come flooding back to the job market, inflating unemployment numbers. All this adds to unemployment being a lagging, not a leading, market and economic indicator. <p></p> As I show in <i>Debunkery</i>, it would be weird, perverse, and inconsistent with all of history for unemployment to rise before the economy recovers. Your time would be better spent worrying about almost anything else&#x2014;maybe reruns of the <i>Beverly Hillbillies</i>. <p></p> <b>You encourage investors to do better with mutual funds by sending their spouse on a spending spree? </b><br> Yes! Many investors think their &#x201c;no-load&#x201d; mutual funds (i.e., mutual funds without a sales charge) are a cheap way to diversify. I have no issue with no-load mutual funds versus load funds. But it&#x2019;s a proven fact that, on average, no-load fund investors do much worse than the funds themselves and they badly lag the S&amp;P 500&#x2014;and even lag investors who invest in funds with heavy loads. Why? Because no-load funds are convenient to trade, so they do it&#x2014;much too often. They make moves at the wrong times, and that seriously hurts. <p></p> The fee load fund investors pay up front&#x2014;sometimes as much as 5%&#x2014;serves as a behavioral spine. They trade far less, hold their funds much longer&#x2014;don&#x2019;t in-and-out at all the wrong times, buying high and selling low&#x2014;so their performance over time is much better <i>even including those outrageous load fund fees</i>. No-load fund investors on average hold their funds way too short a time for their own good because they trade them whenever they feel the urge, not having that behavioral &#x201c;spine&#x201d; the load fund investor feels. <p></p> What no-load mutual fund investors need is an artificial &#x201c;spine&#x201d; as a barrier to get them to trade less and hold longer. So, my point is, buy no-load funds but set up a contract with your spouse first. Every time you trade them you must forfeit 5% to your spouse that he or she can do whatever they want with&#x2014;to be blown on whatever frivolous (or non-frivolous) thing they want. The threat of a punitive spousal shopping spree can be just the discipline you need to trade less. And even over a period as short as 5 years, the benefit of sitting tight should easily outweigh the cost of creating your 5% artificial spine. It also motivates you to pick your funds more carefully. <p></p>Want to become a better investor? Send your spouse on a shopping spree! It's no joke&#x2014;this book shows you why. <p>Far too many investors fail to get the results they want because they make some pretty common mistakes. The problem is, the errors don't seem like mistakes&#x2014;they seem like smart, intuitive, and/or widely recognized investing "wisdom." But much of what's accepted as investing "wisdom" is, instead, bunk. How can investors tell bunk from reality?</p> <p><i>Debunkery: Learn It, Do It, and Profit From It&#x2014;Seeing Through Wall Street's Money-Killing Myths</i> from legendary money manager, longtime Forbes columnist, and best-selling author Ken Fisher shows you how to avoid the costly errors many investors make when they rely upon "common sense" thinking, intuition, gut instinct, or clich�s&#x2014;by using debunkery! Debunkery isn't difficult&#x2014;it just requires the willingness to flip common investing "wisdom" on its head. Once readers learn to do that, they can begin seeing the investing world more clearly and stop falling prey to costly bunk.</p> <p>Fisher demonstrates debunkery on 50 of Wall Street's widely accepted "truths" and details in an easily accessible (and always entertaining) way why:</p> <ul> <li>Stop-losses could be renamed stop-gains.</li> <li>High unemployment isn't bad for stocks.</li> <li>Massive trade deficits can be great for stocks.</li> <li>Stocks don't care if the US dollar is strong or weak.</li> <li>Most retirees have a long, long time to invest.</li> <li>You should never listen to your "gut" when it comes to investing.</li> <li>You are almost certainly too terrified of government debt.</li> <li>Consumer confidence doesn't matter.</li> <li>Sending your spouse on a shopping spree could get you better long-term investing results.</li> </ul> <p>In investing, there are no simple rules that say, "always sell on this one condition, and buy on that one," that work consistently and repeatedly. If only investing were that easy! <i>Debunkery</i> shows you why many Wall Street "truths" are, in reality, money-killing myths and walks you through ways you can begin improving your error rate right away. <i>Debunkery</i> debunks 50 common myths, but also gives you the tools to continue engaging in debunkery for the rest of your investing career.</p></p><h2>Becoming MomStrong Bible Study: A Six-Week Journey to Discover Your God-Given Calling</h2><p><b>A six-week guided journey of learning to trust God with your deepest parenting questions.</b><br>There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with good advice&#x2015;but today&#x2019;s moms need so much more than that.

This powerful and disturbing study in the pathology of modern life is one of the masterworks of a writer whom as Anthony Burgess once remarked, was "always trying to get to the bottom of the human imbroglio."</p><p>Alberto Moravia (1907-1990), the child of a wealthy family, was raised at home because of illness. He published his first novel,<i>The Time of Indifference,</i>&nbsp;at the age of twenty-three.

Among his best-known books to have appeared in English are Boredom, The Woman of Rome, The Conformist (the basis for Bernardo Bertolucci&#x2019;s film), Roman Tales, Contempt (the basis for Jean-Luc Godard&#x2019;s film), and Two Women.<br><br>William Weaver is celebrated for his numerous translations from the Italian, including Umberto Eco&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Name of the Rose</i>&nbsp;and novels and stories by Italo Calvino.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C.-A.D. 871 (Norton Library History of England)</h2><p><p><strong>"An excellent introduction to an obscure and difficult period." &#x2015;<em>The Economist</em></strong></p> By the time of Caesar's first expedition to Britain in 55 B.C., migratory movements had established close ties of kinship and common interest between the peoples who lived in Gaul and some of the inhabitants of Britain. Because the source material is so meager for much of early British history, Mr. Blair is careful to explain just how scholars have arrived at an accurate knowledge of the first 900 years.<br><br> The real history of Britain begins with the Roman occupation, for the Romans were the first to leave substantial documentary and archaeological evidence. After the governorship of Agricola the written sources almost entirely disappear until the early Anglo-Saxon era of the fifth century; but archaeologists have been able to gather a great deal of information about the intervening centuries from excavations of old walled towns, roads, and fortresses dating from the Roman period. Mr. Blair skillfully describes the transition from Roman to Saxon England and shows why Rome's greatest legacy to her former colony&#x2015;Christianity&#x2015;flowered within Anglo-Saxon culture. The source material on Saxon England is mainly documentary, as these new inhabitants built in wood and little archaeological evidence has survived. However, Bede's Ecclesiatical History of the English Nation and other great Christian writings, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Beowulf, the stories of Caedmon, and other poems and epics in the Germanic minstrelsy tradition, have revealed much about English economic, social, and cultural life up to the accession of Alfred the Great.</p><p>The special aim of this series is to provide serious and yet challenging books, not buried under a mountain of detail.

But through this fantastic journey, he also gave to literature an enduring model of mankind&#x2019;s follies, vulnerabilities, vanities, and self-destructiveness. Dangerously topical in its own time and much debated ever since, <em>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</em> is among those works of English literature that entrap and challenge readers in every period. </p> <p> This edition uses the 1735 edition as the copy text, retaining the original, unmodernized text.

Allan Ingram&#x2019;s engaging introduction deftly combines a summary of contemporary controversies over politics, religion, learning, science, and Ireland, with a summary of Swift&#x2019;s life and a history of the composition, publication, and critical reception of the <em>Travels</em>. The footnotes to the text anticipate the kinds of knowledge a twenty-first-century reader might lack: the outmoded usage of a single word or the identity of an individual, as well as references to broader issues and ideas.

Charlotte Bront�'s last novel, published in 1853, has a dramatic force comparable to that of her other masterpiece, <b>Jane Eyre</b>, as well as strikingly modern psychological insight and a revolutionary understanding of human loneliness. With an introduction by Lucy Hughes-Hallet.<br><br></p></p><p>With her final novel, <i>Villette</i>, Charlotte Bronte reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte&#39;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.</p><h2>Numero Zero</h2><p><b>From the best-selling author of <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and <i>The Prague Cemetery,</i> a novel about the murky world of media politics, conspiracy, and murder</b><br><br>A newspaper committed to blackmail&nbsp;and&nbsp;mud slinging,&nbsp;rather than reporting the news.<br> &nbsp;<br> A paranoid editor, walking through the streets of Milan, reconstructing fifty years of history against the backdrop of a plot involving the cadaver of Mussolini's double.<br> &nbsp;<br> The murder of Pope John Paul I, the CIA, red terrorists handled by secret services, twenty years of bloodshed,&nbsp;and&nbsp;events that seem outlandish until the BBC proves them true.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fragile love story between two born losers, a failed ghost writer, and a vulnerable girl, who specializes in celebrity gossip yet cries over the second movement of Beethoven&#x2019;s Seventh.

Drawing on their in-depth study of the practices of ninety auto assembly plants in seventeen countries and their interviews with individual employees, scholars, and union and government officials, the authors of this compelling study uncover the specific manufacturing techniques behind Japan's success and show how Western industry can implement these innovative methods. <i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> tells the fascinating story of "lean production," a manufacturing system that results in a better, more cost-efficient product, higher productivity, and greater customer loyalty. The hallmarks of lean production are teamwork, communication, and efficient use of resources. And the results are remarkable: cars with one-third the defects, built in half the factory space, using half the man-hours. <i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> explains in concrete terms what lean production is, how it really works, and--as it inevitably spreads beyond the auto industry--its significant global impact. </p></p><p><br> Daniel Roos, Ph.D., is director of the International Motor Vehicle Program at MIT.

Jones is the program's European research director.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>THE INDUSTRY OF INDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION</b><br><br>Forty years ago Peter Drucker dubbed it "the industry of industries." Today, automobile manufacturing is still the world's largest manufacturing activity, with nearly 50 million new vehicles produced each year.<br><br>Most of us own one, many of us own several, and, although we may be unaware of it, these cars and trucks are an important part of our everyday lives.<br><br>Yet the auto industry is even more important to us than it appears. Twice in this century it has changed our most fundamental ideas of how we make things. And how we make things dictates not only how we work but what we buy, how we think, and the way we live.<br><br>After World War I, Henry Ford and General Motors' Alfred Sloan moved world manufacture from centuries of craft production -- led by European firms -- into the age of mass production. Largely as a result, the United States soon dominated the global economy.<br><br>After World War II, Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno at the Toyota Motor Company in Japan pioneered the concept of lean production. The rise of Japan to its current economic preeminence quickly followed, as other Japanese companies and industries copied this remarkable system.<br><br>Manufacturers around the world are now trying to embrace lean production, but they're finding the going rough. The companies that first mastered this system were all headquartered in one country -- Japan. As lean production has spread to North America and Western Europe under their aegis, trade wars and growing resistance to foreign investment have followed.<br><br>Today, we hear constantly that the world faces a massive overcapacity crisis -- estimated by some industry executives at more than 8 million units in excess of current world sales of about 50 million units. This is, in fact, a misnomer. The world has an acute shortage of competitive lean-production capacity and a vast glut of uncompetitive mass-production capacity. The crisis is caused by the former threatening the latter.<br><br>Many Western companies now understand lean production, and at least one is well along the path to introducing it. However, superimposing lean-production methods on existing mass-production systems causes great pain and dislocation. In the absence of a crisis threatening the very survival of the company, only limited progress seems to be possible.<br><br>General Motors is the most striking example. This gigantic company is still the world's largest industrial concern and was without doubt the best at mass production, a system it helped to create. Now, in the age of lean production, it finds itself with too many managers, too many workers, and too many plants. Yet GM has not yet faced a life-or-death crisis, as the Ford Motor Company did in the early 1980s, and thus it has not been able to change.<br><br>This book is an effort to ease the necessary transition from mass production to lean. By focusing on the global auto industry, we explain in simple, concrete terms what lean production is, where it came from, how it really works, and how it can spread to all corners of the globe for everyone's mutual benefit.<br><br>But why should we care if world manufacturers jettison decades of mass production to embrace lean production? Because the adoption of lean production, as it inevitably spreads beyond the auto industry, will change everything in almost every industry -- choices for consumers, the nature of work, the fortune of companies, and, ultimately, the fate of nations.<br><br>What is lean production? Perhaps the best way to describe this innovative production system is to contrast it with craft production and mass production, the two other methods humans have devised to make things.<br><br>The craft producer uses highly skilled workers and simple but flexible tools to make exactly what the consumer asks for -- one item at a time. Custom furniture, works of decorative art, and a few exotic sports cars provide current-day examples. We all love the idea of craft production, but the problem with it is obvious: Goods produced by the craft method -- as automobiles once were exclusively -- cost too much for most of us to afford. So mass production was developed at the beginning of the twentieth century as an alternative.<br><br>The mass-producer uses narrowly skilled professionals to design products made by unskilled or semiskilled workers tending expensive, single-purpose machines. These churn out standardized products in very high volume. Because the machinery costs so much and is so intolerant of disruption, the mass-producer adds many buffers -- extra supplies, extra workers, and extra space -- to assure smooth production. Because changing over to a new product costs even more, the mass-producer keeps standard designs in production for as long as possible. The result: The consumer gets lower costs but at the expense of variety and by means of work methods that most employees find boring and dispiriting.<br><br>The lean producer, by contrast, combines the advantages of craft and mass production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the rigidity of the latter. Toward this end, lean producers employ teams of multiskilled workers at all levels of the organization and use highly flexible, increasingly automated machines to produce volumes of products in enormous variety.<br><br>Lean production (a term coined by IMVP researcher John Krafcik) is "lean" because it uses less of everything compared with mass production half the human effort in the factory, half the manufacturing space, half the investment in tools, half the engineering hours to develop a new product in half the time. Also, it requires keeping far less than half the needed inventory on site, results in many fewer defects, and produces a greater and ever growing variety of products.<br><br>Perhaps the most striking difference between mass production and lean production lies in their ultimate objectives. Mass-producers set a limited goal for themselves -- "good enough," which translates into an acceptable number of defects, a maximum acceptable level of inventories, a narrow range of standardized products. To do better, they argue, would cost too much or exceed inherent human capabilities.<br><br>Lean producers, on the other hand, set their sights explicitly on perfection: continually declining costs, zero defects, zero inventories, and endless product variety. Of course, no lean producer has ever reached this promised land -- and perhaps none ever will, but the endless quest for perfection continues to generate surprising twists.<br><br>For one, lean production changes how people work but not always in the way we think. Most people -- including so-called blue-collar workers -- will find their jobs more challenging as lean production spreads. And they will certainly become more productive. At the same time, they may find their work more stressful, because a key objective of lean production is to push responsibility far down the organizational ladder. Responsibility means freedom to control one's work -- a big plus -- but it also raises anxiety about making costly mistakes.<br><br>Similarly, lean production changes the meaning of professional careers. In the West, we are accustomed to think of careers as a continual progression to ever higher levels of technical know-how and proficiency in an ever narrower area of specialization as well as responsibility for ever larger numbers of subordinates -- director of accounting, chief production engineer, and so on.<br><br>Lean production calls for learning far more professional skills and applying these creatively in a team setting rather than in a rigid hierarchy. The paradox is that the better you are at teamwork, the less you may know about a specific, narrow specialty that you can take with you to another company or to start a new business. What's more, many employees may find the lack of a steep career ladder with ever more elaborate titles and job descriptions both disappointing and disconcerting.<br><br>If employees are to prosper in this environment, companies must offer them a continuing variety of challenges. That way, they will feel they are honing their skills and are valued for the many kinds of expertise they have attained. Without these continual challenges, workers may feel they have reached a dead end at an early point in their career. The result: They hold back their know-how and commitment, and the main advantage of lean production disappears.<br><br>This sketch of lean production and its effects is highly simplified, of course. Where did this new idea come from and precisely how does it work in practice? Why will it result in such profound political and economic changes throughout the world? In this book we provide the answers.<br><br>In "The Origins of Lean Production," we trace the evolution of lean production. We then look in "The Elements of Lean Production" at how lean production works in factory operations, product development, supply-system coordination, customer relations and as a total lean enterprise.<br><br>Finally, in "Diffusing Lean Production," we examine how lean production is spreading across the world and to other industries and, in the process, is revolutionizing how we live and work. As we'll also see, however, lean production isn't spreading everywhere at a uniform rate. So we'll look at the barriers that are preventing companies and countries from becoming lean. And we'll suggest creative ways leanness can be achieved.<br><br>Copyright � 1990 by James P. Womack, Daniel T.

Albright's statement (made a quarter of a century ago) "that all future investigations of the book of Psalms must deal intensively with the Ugaritic texts."<br><br>This translation tries to capture as much as possible the poetic qualities of the original Hebrew.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its attempt is to render accurately not only the meaning of the Psalms but their poetic forms and rhythms as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process of probing the original, Father Dahood unearths some striking examples of passages previously mistranslated, and arrives at many provocative readings.</p><p>Mitchell Dahood, S.J., was Professor of Ugaritic Language and Literature at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome up to his death in 1982.

Not the least of these occurred when Apuleius offended a priestess of the White Goddess, who turned him into an ass. The tale of how Apuleius dealt with this misfortune and eventually resumed human form is conveyed by Robert Graves in modern English that is infused with a bawdy wit and sense of adventure that is "itself a small masterpiece of twentieth-century prose" (Kenneth Rexroth, <i>Saturday Review</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Graves</b> (1895-1985) was a poet, novelist, and translator.</p><br>"An execllent introduction and an accurate...translation."--Jim Williams, <em>SUNY at Genesco</em><p></p><br>"This translation deserves the highest praise.

Schr�dinger led a very intense life, both in his research and in the personal realm. This book portrays his life against the backdrop of Europe at a time of change and unrest. His best known scientific work was the discovery of wave mechanics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1933. In Dublin, he wrote his most famous and influential book What is Life?, which attracted some of the brightest minds of his generation into molecular biology. This highly readable biography of a fascinating and complex man will appeal to anyone interested in the history of our times, and in the life and thought of one of the great men of twentieth-century science.</p><p>This is a biography of the great scientist, Erwin Schr�dinger (author of What is Life?), which draws upon recollections of his family and friends, as well as on contemporary records, diaries and letters.

I have invented nothing.&#39; Natalia Ginzburg wrote her masterful, Strega Prize winning novel Family Lexicon while living in London in the 1960s. Homesick for her big, noisy Italian family, she summoned them in this novel, which is a celebration of the routines and rituals, in-jokes and insults and, above all, the repeated sayings that make up every family. The father, Giuseppe Levi, is a Jewish scientist, consumed by his work and a mania for hiking. Impatient and intractable, he is constantly at odds with his impressionable and wistful wife Lidia - yet he cannot be without her. Together they preside over their five children in a house filled with argument and activity, books and politics, visitors, friends and famous faces. But as their children grow up against the backdrop of Mussolini&#39;s Italy, the Levi household must become not only a home - but a stronghold against fascism. Intimate, enchanting and comedic, Family Lexicon is an unforgettable novel about memory, language, and the lasting power that family holds over all of us. &#39;It is perhaps best to say straight off that the book is a masterpiece.&#39; New Yorker &#39;A small, entrancing classic.&#39; Hermione Lee</p><p></p><h2>The Crucible of Islam</h2><p><p>Little is known about Arabia in the sixth century CE. Yet from this distant time and place emerged a faith and an empire that stretched from the Iberian peninsula to India. Today, Muslims account for nearly a quarter of the global population. G. W. Bowersock seeks to illuminate this most obscure and yet most dynamic period in the history of Islam&#x2015;from the mid-sixth to mid-seventh century&#x2015;exploring why arid Arabia proved to be such fertile ground for Muhammad&#x2019;s prophetic message, and why that message spread so quickly to the wider world.</p><p>In Muhammad&#x2019;s time Arabia stood at the crossroads of great empires, a place where Christianity, Judaism, and local polytheistic traditions vied for adherents. Mecca, Muhammad&#x2019;s birthplace, belonged to the part of Arabia recently conquered by the Ethiopian Christian king Abraha. But Ethiopia lost western Arabia to Persia following Abraha&#x2019;s death, while the death of the Byzantine emperor in 602 further destabilized the region. Within this chaotic environment, where lands and populations were traded frequently among competing powers and belief systems, Muhammad began winning converts to his revelations. In a troubled age, his followers coalesced into a powerful force, conquering Palestine, Syria, and Egypt and laying the groundwork of the Umayyad Caliphate.</p><p>The crucible of Islam remains an elusive vessel. Although we may never grasp it firmly, Bowersock offers the most detailed description of its contours and the most compelling explanation of how one of the world&#x2019;s great religions took shape.</p></p><p>G. W. Bowersock is Professor Emeritus of Ancient History at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.&#x201c;<i>The Crucible of Islam</i> is a remarkable work of scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Carroll</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Erudite and lucid...Bowersock&#x2019;s fluency with specialist literature and his ability to transform scattered research into a coherent narrative are admirable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Chase Robinson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;To write about the Arabian background of the Prophet Muhammad, about the origin of Islam in Mecca and Medina, and about the first conquests that led to the formation of the Arab empire (roughly between 560 and 690 AD) is to attempt to describe the first moments of a supernova&#x2015;the flash of a stupendous detonation that marks the death of a massive star and the release of enormous amounts of energy. G.W. Bowersock has met this challenge in a little book of explosive originality and penetrating judgment...With <i>The Crucible of Islam</i> we reach the very center of this roiling world. We look into the depths of the crucible itself, to seize, in a true historical perspective, the &#x2018;molten ingredients&#x2019; that came to form Islam. His book is an exercise in the art of historical truth. Bowersock is a classical scholar. He derives his skills from a tradition that reaches back to the Renaissance, to Erasmus and to Lorenzo Valla, whose demolition of the legendary Donation of Constantine he has himself translated with gusto. His book derives its strength from the method advocated by the great classical scholar Richard Bentley (1662&#x2013;1742): <i>ratio et res ipsa</i>&#x2015;reason confronting the thing itself...Part of the joy of reading this account of the background and emergence of early Islam is the knowledge that Bowersock has built it from solid stones, the weight of every one of which he has tested with his own critical mind. Secure that we are in the hands of a master, let us think about the implications of the substantial gains to scholarship that Bowersock has brought us in this compressed masterpiece...We must be grateful to Bowersock for giving us, at this time, a masterpiece of the historian&#x2019;s craft.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Brown</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This work is highly recommended for those interested in the religious and political attitudes that gave rise to Islam.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Muhammed Hassanali</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Bowersock paints a concise portrait of Islam&#x2019;s early formation and consolidation, focusing on the political, social, economic, and religious conditions of 6th- and 7th-century Arabia...Bowersock clearly and succinctly describes the stage upon which Islam emerged, and also dispels certain rumors, myths, and half-histories that have come to dominate popular notions of the period (and even persist in scholarship)...Given the historical and current relationships and tensions among various groups of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, this brief and easily digestible introduction will interest and please a wide variety of readers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is an invaluable examination of the origins of a great religion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>G.

In this classic work on gardening in dry climates, first published in 2008, Olivier Filippi offers practical advice to achieve this goal based on his, and his wife Clara's, experience of working with Mediterranean-region plants for more than 30 years. The first part of the book examines the behavior of plants that face drought in their natural habitat. What is drought and how do plants manage to survive when little water is available? The second part is concerned with gardening techniques in a dry climate. How do you prepare the soil, when do you plant, and how do you maintain a dry garden?

Political and military leaders on both sides viewed the Hudson River Valley as the American jugular, which, if cut, would quickly bleed the rebellion to death.</p><p>So in 1776, King George III sent the largest amphibious force ever assembled to seize Manhattan and use it as a base from which to push up the Hudson River Valley for a grand rendezvous at Albany with an impressive army driving down from Canada. George Washington and every other patriot leader shared the king&#x2019;s fixation with the Hudson. Generations of American and British historians have held the same view. In fact, one of the few things that scholars have agreed upon is that the British strategy, though disastrously executed, should have been swift and effective. Until now, no one has argued that this plan of action was lunacy from the beginning.</p><p><em>Revolution on the Hudson</em> makes the bold new argument that Britain&#x2019;s attempt to cut off New England never would have worked, and that doggedly pursuing dominance of the Hudson ultimately cost the crown her colonies. It unpacks intricate military maneuvers on land and sea, introduces the personalities presiding over each side&#x2019;s strategy, and reinterprets the vagaries of colonial politics to offer a thrilling response to one of our most vexing historical questions: How could a fledgling nation have defeated the most powerful war machine of the era?</p><p>George C.

The work of this terminally alienated master narrator of the subconscious demanded a new descriptor; I guess they gave up and just settled on "Kafkaesque." But if you ever wonder what the original Kafkaesque work was, take a look here. The book contains all of Kafka's short and longer stories -- everything but his three novels. Most of these stories weren't even published during the author's lifetime. The widely-anthologized <i>The Metamorphosis</i> is here, wherein Gregor Samsa awakes from uneasy dreams to find himself insectoidally transformed, as are equally lovely pieces like <i>A Hunger Artist</i>, <i>A Country Doctor</i> and <i>A Little Woman</i>.The only available collection that brings together all of Kafka&#39;s stories--those published during his lifetime and those released after his death.</p><h2>Fathers and Sons (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p>Depicts generational conflict in a portrayal of a young man&#39;s attempts to convert his father to his own radical political ideas.</p><p>When &#34;Fathers and Sons was first published in Russia, in 1862, it was met with a blaze of controversy about where Turgenev stood in relation to his account of generational misunderstanding. Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, and playwright whose novel Fathers and Sons is regarded as one of the major works of nineteenth-century fiction.<br><br>Sean Runnette, a multiple AudioFile Earphones Award winner, has also produced several Audie Award-winning audiobooks.

Based on ABA methods, learners are taught using a system of graduated guidance--physical prompts systematically faded as performance increases. Once the individual has mastered their use, he or she can independently follow a schedule to engage in activities at home, at school, and during leisure time. For example, activity schedules can cue an individual to prepare food with minimal assistance, interact with classmates, and complete a puzzle. </p><p> Based on over 20 years of research the authors have conducted at the Princeton Child Development Institute, the second edition discusses the latest research that points to positive outcomes from using activity schedules, including better self-management, decreased problem behaviors, and skill generalization, among other findings. The new edition includes:</p><p> -How to use activity schedules to organize all aspects of a person's daily activities, and increase engagement, task completion, making appropriate choices, and sequencing activities;</p><p> -An expanded section on the use of activity schedules by adults, describing how they are used at home and in the workplace and via iPods and Blackberries;</p><p> -How to use activity schedules to promote social interaction and to teach children to point to and show objects to others in order to share a social experience.</p><p> Detailed instructions and examples help parents prepare their child's first schedule, then progress to more varied and sophisticated schedules, leading to greater independence. </p><p> <i>Also by the authors</i>:<br> <b>Teaching Conversation to Children with Autism</b></p></p><p>The bestselling guide to creating and using activity schedules a set of pictures or words that cues a child or adult to engage in a sequence of activities is newly revised and updated. The benefits of using activity schedules as a teaching tool with people with autism of all ages include getting them to be more self-directed and encouraging them to initiate tasks without supervision, whether during leisure time, in the classroom, or during daily routines at home. This new edition includes more information about how to use these schedules with adults in residential settings and in the workplace, as well as how to make the transition from a photographic or written schedule to a digital device such as an iPod or Blackberry.<p> The second edition also points to new research that shows additional ways this simple but revolutionary tool can help: Activity schedules can decrease problem behaviors during less structured times, increases interactions with peers, and their use helps people with autism to apply what they learned in one situation to another task in a different setting. Schedules also foster the ability to seek attention, leading to more meaningful social connections. Kids with autism learn to ask their parent to look at a picture theyve drawn, watch them in an activity, or show a favorite toy to a peer. The authors also describe the advantage of using schedules across all daily activities, not just for isolated tasks, because their use increases the level and length of engagement, the ability to make appropriate choices, to complete tasks, and to go through the day with less supervision. Dozens of real-life anecdotes, photos and charts help to explain techniques, ways to monitor progress, and how to teach different types of skills. This guide will continue to guide thousands of parents and teachers in using this invaluable tool, which brings greater independence to people with autism.</p>Lynn E.

Many of her paintings embody her felt responses to trees, water, fields and flowers. Frantic swirls of colors are suspended in equilibrium; powerful, slashing strokes remind one of Franz Kline but are more organic. The later pictures are open and airy, often exploding in colorful calligraphic gestures. Mitchell likens her artistic goal to stopping time, as in a still photograph. In examining the way she achieves her effects, Bernstock, assistant professor of art history at Cornell, shows how the artist drew inspiration for her pictures from poets Wallace Stevens, Frank O'Hara, Rilke, Wordsworth and Baudelaire.

In this brilliant satire of rigid Victorian society, Carroll also illuminates the fears, anxieties, and complexities of growing up. He was one of the few adult writers to enter successfully the children&#x2019;s world of make-believe, where the impossible becomes possible, the unreal, real, and where the heights of adventure are limited only by the depths of imagination.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>With an Introduction by Martin Gardner</b><br><b>and an Afterword by Jeffrey Meyers</b><br><b>and the Original Illustrations by John Tenniel</b></p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

The author's painstakingly comprehensive research throws fresh light on the nature of the disease, its origin, its spread, on an almost day-to-day basis, across Europe, Asia Minor, the Middle East and North Africa, its mortality rate and its impact on history. These latter two aspects are of central importance here, for it is demonstrated that the plague's death rates have consistently been under-estimated and that they were in fact much higher, making the disease's long-term effects on history even more profound.<br><br>OLE J. BENEDICTOW is Professor of History at the University of Oslo.</p><p>OLE J. BENEDICTOW is Professor of History at the University of Oslo.Two theses form the structure of this book: that the Black Death was the bubonic form of the rodent disease Yersinia pestis and was spread by fleas, and that it killed 60 percent or more of Europe's population with its first strike alone. To sustain these theses, the author has divided the book into 34 chapters that chart the spread of the plague country by country, even to places where few, if any, sources survive. But in places without sources or where the appearance of the Black Death was not reported, Benedictow nonetheless asserts that the plague struck and, except for a few tiny, isolated islands of population, killed 60 percent or more. In his argument that the plague was caused by Y. pestis, Benedictow relies heavily on the reports of the Indian Plague Research Commission, which were published during the first two decades of the 20th century. However, he has read these reports selectively. For instance, he maintains that the black rat (Rattus rattus) was responsible for plague in the years 1346 through 1353 as well as during the 20th century, but the Indian plague researchers found as many dead brown rats as black ones in dwellings where infection was active. In other, subtropical, zones such as northern Africa, scientists found that the black rat was the least important rat in the spread of plague to human populations; the brown rat and others such as Mus alexandrinus proved more deadly. Benedictow claims that "plague normally arrived with persons unwittingly carrying infective rat fleas in their clothing or luggage." But from studies of the clothing and luggage of tens of thousands of people migrating from plague-stricken regions, the plague commissioners concluded overwhelmingly that Y. pestis was not transmitted by these means. Benedictow argues that the Black Death and Y. pestis were both specific to households in terms of mortality -- if one member of a household contracted plague, the others soon became infected. The plague commissioners found the opposite to be true: in less than 4 percent of households was more than one person per household infected. Benedictow maintains that people in well-built stone housing were protected against plague because rats could not enter these dwellings. The plague commissioners again discovered the opposite: that rats penetrated stone and brick houses, even those with cement floors, inflicting some of the highest rates of death in these residences, whereas often some of the poorest people, living in bamboo huts, fared much better. Benedictow claims that during both plagues hospital workers were more susceptible than others. Yet in study after study, the plague commissioners reported that "the safest place to be in plague time is the plague ward." To their surprise, and in contrast to the experience during the Black Death, Y. pestis is hardly contagious even in its pneumonic form. Historians have realized since the work of Graham Twigg, in 1984, that the Black Death and the subtropical Y. pestis traveled at vastly different speeds. Even with the railway and the steamship, the 20th-century plague, because of its dependence on the homebound rat, spread overland at about 8 miles per year, whereas the contagious Black Death almost equaled that speed per day. Nonetheless, Benedictow tries to bring the two time frames closer together. He speeds up the 20th-century plague by reporting infection times only for California, where the disease is carried by the prairie dog, not the homebound rat, and has been known to move as fast as 15 miles per year. Benedictow devotes considerably more space to the slowing of the Black Death. For instance, he makes claims for earlier dates of departure of the plague at a given place, arguing that chroniclers or wills recorded the disease only after it had struck the elite members of a population; but then he does not use the same rules when discussing the plague's arrival at a second place. More often, however, Benedictow casts aside any rate of disease spread that was faster than he likes: at these junctures, the Black Death made "metastatic leaps." But even with his various stratagems, his results still show the medieval plague traveling 30 times as fast as the modern one -- a discrepancy he does not explain or even admit to. Casuistic sleights of hand plague Benedictow's demography almost as much as they do his epidemiology. When the data do not cooperate, he questions or rejects them outright. For instance, statistics from Mallorca show mortality rates of only 23 percent, but Benedictow brushes them aside, claiming that they are "infested with major problems of demography, sociology and source criticism both with respect to the level of total mortality" -- that is, Benedictow's thesis that the Black Death everywhere killed off 60 percent or more of populations -- "and to the distribution of mortality between town and countryside." Benedictow claims that the distribution of mortality rates for the Black Death shows the patterns of Y. pestis infection in 20th-century India -- that the larger the population of a given place, the lower its rate of mortality. To make the data from the two plagues fit, he not only argues that the mortality rate from the Black Death was greater than the records say, he also argues the opposite, asserting that the most authoritative population statistics for Florence, Italy, for instance -- those of Herlihy and Klapisch -- are wrong, simply because they do not square with the Y. pestis deaths distributed over city and countryside. But, again, ultimately even his manipulation of the figures fails: his doctored mortality rates for the midsize town of Prato, in Italy, and the smaller villages of its countryside (contado), for instance, were the same (42.5 to 45 percent), and both were considerably lower than the rates for its much larger regional center, Florence. Benedictow's two overarching theses collide in the end. The mortality figures for Y. pestis, even in India -- where 95 percent of deaths from plague have been recorded since the discovery of the bacillus in 1894 -- accounted for less than 1 percent of India's population even during the years of highest mortality from plague. One must compare this with Benedictow's claim that 60 percent or more of Europe died from the Black Death in a single strike of the disease. <i>Samuel K.

Faber leads us back to 1870s London, where Sugar, a nineteen-year-old whore in the brothel of the terrifying Mrs. Castaway, yearns for escape to a better life. Her ascent through the strata of Victorian society offers us intimacy with a host of lovable, maddening, unforgettable characters. They begin with William Rackham, an egotistical perfume magnate whose ambition is fueled by his lust for Sugar, and whose patronage brings her into proximity to his extended family and milieu: his unhinged, childlike wife, Agnes, who manages to overcome her chronic hysteria to make her appearances during &#x201c;the Season&#x201d;; his mysteriously hidden-away daughter, Sophie, left to the care of minions; his pious brother, Henry, foiled in his devotional calling by a persistently less-than-chaste love for the Widow Fox, whose efforts on behalf of The Rescue Society lead Henry into ever-more disturbing confrontations with flesh; all this overseen by assorted preening socialites, drunken journalists, untrustworthy servants, vile guttersnipes, and whores of all stripes and persuasions. <br>Twenty years in its conception, research, and writing, <i>The Crimson Petal and the White</i> is teeming with life, rich in texture and incident, with characters breathtakingly real. In a class by itself, it's a big, juicy, must-read of a novel that will delight, enthrall, provoke, and entertain young and old, male and female. <br></p><p>Although it's billed as "the first great 19th-century novel of the 21st century," <i>The Crimson Petal and the White</i> is anything but Victorian. The story of a well-read London prostitute named Sugar, who spends her free hours composing a violent, pornographic screed against men, Michel Faber's dazzling second novel dares to go where George Eliot's <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> and the works of Charles Dickens could not. We learn about the positions and orifices that Sugar and her clients favor, about her lingering skin condition, and about the suspect ingredients of her prophylactic douches. Still, Sugar believes she can make a better life for herself. When she is taken up by a wealthy man, the perfumer William Rackham, her wings are clipped, and she must balance financial security against the obvious servitude of her position. The physical risks and hardships of Sugar's life (and the even harder "honest" life she would have led as a factory worker) contrast--yet not entirely--with the medical mistreatment of her benefactor's wife, Agnes, and beautifully underscore Faber's emphasis on class and sexual politics. In theme and treatment, this is a novel that Virginia Woolf might have written, had she been born 70 years later. The language, however, is Faber's own--brisk and elastic--and, after an awkward opening, the plethora of detail he offers (costume, food, manners, cheap stage performances, the London streets) slides effortlessly into his forward-moving sentences. When Agnes goes mad, for instance, "she sings on and on, while the house is discreetly dusted all around her and, in the concealed and subterranean kitchen, a naked duck, limp and faintly steaming, spreads its pimpled legs on a draining board." Despite its 800-plus pages, <i>The Crimson Petal and the White</i> turns out to be a quick read, since it is truly impossible to put down. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2002, 0-15-100692-X<br></p><h2>God So Loved the World: Clues to Our Transcendent Destiny from the Revelation of Jesus (Happiness, Suffering, and Transcendence) (Volume 3)</h2><p><p>In this volume the brilliant Fr. Spitzer probes in detail the major question that if an intelligent Creator God &#x2013; manifest in logical proofs, scientific evidence, and near death experiences - who is the source of our desire for the sacred, and the transcendental desires for truth, love, goodness, and beauty, would want to reveal himself to us personally and ultimately.</p><p>He then shows this is reasonable not only in light of our interior experience of a transcendent Reality, but also that a completely intelligent Reality is completely positive--implying its possession of a completely positive virtue &#x2013; namely "love", defined as agape.</p><p>This leads to the question whether God might be unconditionally loving, and if he is, whether he would want to make a personal appearance to us in a perfect act of empathy &#x2013; face to face. After examining the rational evidence for this, he reviews all world religions to see if there is one that reveals such a God &#x2013; an unconditionally loving God who would want to be with us in perfect empathy. This leads us to the extraordinary claim of Jesus Christ who taught that God is "Abba", the unconditionally loving Father.</p><p>Jesus' claims go further, saying that He is also unconditional love, and that his mission is to give us that love through an act of complete self-sacrifice. He also claims to be the exclusive Son of the Father, sent by God to save the world, and the one who possesses divine power and authority. The rest of the book does an in-depth examination of the evidence for Jesus' unconditional love of sinners, his teachings, his miracles, and his rising from the dead. As well as the evidence for Jesus' gift of the Holy Spirit that enabled his disciples to perform miracles in his name, and evidence for the presence of the Holy Spirit today.</p><p>If this strong evidence convinces us to believe that Jesus is our ultimate meaning and destiny, and desire His saving presence in our lives, that evidence should galvanize the Holy Spirit within us to show that Jesus is Lord and Savior, "the way, the truth, and the life." And our faith in him will transform everything we think about our nature, dignity, and destiny&#x2013; and how we live, endure suffering, contend with evil, and treat our neighbor.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert J.

Later, he spotted an illustration of a red lobster in a magazine and contacted the creator, Eric Carle, to ask if he would illustrate his poem. So began Eric Carle's career as a children's book illustrator--along with a life-long collaborative friendship with Bill Martin Jr. Since then, <em>Brown Bear</em> and the three companion titles, <em>Polar Bear</em>, <em>Panda Bear</em>, and <em>Baby Bear</em>, have gone on to sell millions of copies worldwide.</p> <p>The Bear books are a cultural landmark and a key milestone in many children's reading lives. And many adults today remember reading the Bear books themselves as well as the experience of reading them for the first time to their own children. Whether in a picture book or a reader, and now in eBook and audio, the same bold graphics and repetitive, rhythmic text have truly stood the test of time.</p> <p>Throughout Eric Carle's career, he has shown an unshakeable commitment to artistic integrity and a dedication to making art accessible to children. His skillfully designed and beautifully rendered collage art is admired by fellow artists, colleagues and fans in equal measure. And in 2002, with his wife Barbara, Eric founded The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, Massachusetts, the first museum of its kind in the United States.</p> <p><em>--Laura Godwin, Vice President and Publisher, Henry Holt Books for Young Readers</em></p> <br> <p><b>A Question for Eric Carle</b></p> <p><strong>Before the Bear books, you worked in advertising but had not yet created a children's book. What went through your mind when you first heard from author Bill Martin Jr. about the <em>Brown Bear</em> manuscript? What made you want to illustrate it?</strong></p> <p><strong>Eric Carle:</strong> At that point I was doing work-for-hire and I was very pleased to have the chance to do something different. I went through the manuscript and could see in my mind images of bright colorful animals, big and bold and simple like in posters. I was actually able to finish the art for this book and deliver it in one weekend. The whole process felt right and I was very excited by the opportunity to work on the book with Bill, which really changed my life and set me on the true course in my career.</p> <p>Eric Carle at work in his studio, Northampton, MA</p> <p>Sketches of Mama Bear for <em>Baby Bear</em></p> <p>Eric Carle, holding a sketch from <em>Baby Bear</em></p><p><b>Bill Martin Jr.</b> (1916-2004) wrote children's books for more than thirty years. He earned a Ph.D. in early childhood education and was a proponent of using rhyme and rhythm to teach young children how to read.</p><p><b>Eric Carle</b>, illustrator of many beloved children's books, was born in the United States, but spent his early years in Stuttgart, Germany, where he studied art and design at the Academy of Applied Art. <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> was the first book he illustrated. eric-carle.com</p></p><h2>Crazy</h2><p>Powerful fiction from National Book Award-winning author Han Nolan.Fifteen-year-old Jason has fallen on bad times&#x2014;his mother has died and his father has succumbed to mental illness.

I talk to them, and yeah, they talk to me, but I know they aren&#x2019;t really there. I&#x2019;m very clear about that. Anyway, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m the only fifteen-year-old who does this. It&#x2019;s our culture. It seems everybody is famous now. You can get yourself on TV for doing almost anything, the stupider the better. Everyone thinks his or her life is movie worthy.<p></p><b> </b>So now you&#x2019;re here. This is my honors English class we&#x2019;re in right now. Don&#x2019;t ask me how I got into honors. Okay, I know this classroom is pretty drab. There aren&#x2019;t nearly enough windows, but it&#x2019;s an old school. They&#x2019;re building a new one over on Clement.<p></p><b> </b>I haven&#x2019;t named you yet. I&#x2019;ll just call you You for now. Maybe you&#x2019;ll just be part of my laugh track, a body filling one of the seats in my theater but having no singular voice. We&#x2019;ll see. If you are part of the laugh track, you get to do more than laugh. You get to say, "Uh-oh," and whisper loudly, "Isn&#x2019;t that a shame." You can even cry. But maybe you&#x2019;ll become one of the outspoken ones, the ones with a personality, like the fat bald guy with a mustache who sits in the back of the theater writing movie reviews. I call him FBG with a mustache, for short. There&#x2019;s also Sexy Lady, who&#x2019;s supposed to just tell me I&#x2019;m hot all the time. She usually has on a low-cut red dress. Then there&#x2019;s Aunt Bee&#x2014;yep, the Aunt Bee from the old Andy Griffith Show. You always wondered what happened to her. Well, here she is, in my head! She&#x2019;s very sympathetic. And finally, there&#x2019;s the kid who Krazy Glued the fingers of his left hand together. I just call him Crazy Glue.<p></p><b> <p></p> CRAZY GLUE:</b> <i>Boring! His life is boring. Get out now while you can. </i><b><p></p> SEXY LADY:</b> <i>Oh, but lately it&#x2019;s been heating up again. He was just in a lull.</i><p></p><b> </b>Yeah, a nice, safe four-year lull. I don&#x2019;t like this new exposure I&#x2019;ve been getting. I liked being invisible.<p></p><b> AUNT BEE:</b> <i>That&#x2019;s most understandable, poor boy. You&#x2019;ve had it very rough in the past. I remember the time your father woke you up in the middle of the night. He had on that horrible mask.<p></p></i><b> FBG WITH A MUSTACHE:</b> <i>It wasn&#x2019;t a mask, my dear. It was a helmet, a Spartan helmet. It was a replica, not the real thing, made of steel with a mane running over the top and down the back of it. Quite authentic-looking, though. It had real horse hair.</i><p></p><b> AUNT BEE:</b> <i>Well, it covered most of his face, and he was frightening coming into Jason&#x2019;s room like that, then scooping him up and taking him outside to bury him. He dropped him right down into that hole he&#x2019;d dug and started shoveling the dirt on top of him. Oh dear, that was so horrifying.<p></p></i><b> CRAZY GLUE (ACTING AS JASON):</b> <i>"Daddy, stop it! I&#x2019;m scared. I don&#x2019;t like it down here. It&#x2019;s cold. I want Mommy.

I wish you&#x2019;d stop reliving that night over and over. It can&#x2019;t be good for you.<p></p></i><b> </b>I was only six. I screamed and screamed. I was scared out of my wits. Dad thought the Furies were after us. Mom said he was just trying to protect me. That&#x2019;s all. <b><p></p> CRAZY GLUE:</b> <i>It figures I missed all the good stuff. And what are Furies, anyway?</i><p></p><b> FBG WITH A MUSTACHE:</b> <i>They&#x2019;re part of Greek and Roman mythology. They&#x2019;re the goddesses of the underworld. You&#x2019;d love them. They have a mass of snakes for hair and blood running from their eyes. They come up through the ground, seeking revenge for people&#x2019;s crimes. They&#x2019;ll hunt you down until you&#x2019;re driven mad with their chase.</i><p></p><b> CRAZY GLUE:</b> <i>Awesome!</i><p></p><b> </b>I didn&#x2019;t think so. The Furies always scared me. They still do. Anyway, my mom heard my screams and she saved me before I was buried alive, but Dad was taken away. He stayed away a long time. That was my fault. I&#x2019;ve always felt it was my fault.<p></p><b> AUNT BEE:</b> <i>Well, dear boy, you couldn&#x2019;t let him bury you alive, could you?<p></p></i><b> SEXY LADY:</b> <i>I think you&#x2019;d look hot in that helmet.<p></p></i> I hate that helmet.

Jason got a swirlie! Cried like a baby, too. Called for his mommy. Made a total fool of himself.</i> <b><p></p> AUNT BEE:</b> <i>Of course he cried, and you would, too. It was his father burying him all over again.<p></p></i><b> CRAZY GLUE:</b> <i>No friends after that&#x2014;just us. Four and a half years now, and still not a single friend. I don&#x2019;t need friends. Friends are dangerous.<p></p></i><b> FBG WITH A MUSTACHE:</b> <i>What was it you and your soccer buddies called yourselves?<p></p></i><b> </b>Fili Mou.

The largest and most important text in the book is a translation of the fullest version of the Old French Continuation of William Tyre for the years 1184-97. This key medieval narrative poses problems for the historian in that it achieved its present form in the 1240s, though it clearly incorporates much earlier material. Professor Edbury's authoritative introduction, notes and maps help interpretation of this and other contemporary texts which are included in this volume, making it an invaluable resource for teachers and students of the crusades.</p><p>Peter Edbury is Reader in Medieval History at the University of Wales, Cardiff.&#39;...Peter Edbury provides a valuable annotated translation...he relates this narrative to other accounts of the same events, pointing out discrepancies, clarifying obvious mistakes, and examining the possible biases of the differing accounts.

It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as "the masterwork of great genius," <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.</p><h2>Human Factors in Aviation</h2><p>This edited textbook is a fully updated and expanded version of the highly successful first edition of Human Factors in Aviation. Written for the widespread aviation community - students, engineers, scientists, pilots, managers, government personnel, etc. HFA offers a comprehensive overview of the topic, taking readers from the general to the specific, first covering broad issues, then the more specific topics of pilot performance, human factors in aircraft design, and vehicles and systems. The new editors offer essential breath of experience on aviation human factors from multiple perspectives (i.e. scientific research, regulation, funding agencies, technology, and implementation) as well as knowledge about the science. The contributors are experts in their fields. Topics carried over from the first edition are fully updated, several by new authors who are now at the fore of the field. New material - which represents 50% of the volume - focuses on the challenges facing aviation specialists today. One of the most significant developments in this decade has been NextGen, the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to modernize national airspace and to address the impact of air traffic growth by increasing airspace capacity and efficiency while simultaneously improving safety, environmental impacts and user access. NextGen issues are covered in full. Other new topics include: High Reliability Organizational Perspective, Situation Awareness &amp; Workload in Aviation, Human Error Analysis, Human-System Risk Management, LOSA, NOSS and Unmanned Aircraft System.</p><p></p><h2>The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition: Romances and Poems</h2><p><p><strong>Upon publication in 1997, <em>The Norton Shakespeare</em> set a new standard for teaching editions of Shakespeare's complete works.</strong></p> Instructors and students worldwide welcomed the fresh scholarship, lively and accessible introductions, helpful marginal glosses and notes, readable single-column format, all designed in support of the goal of the Oxford text: to bring the modern reader closer than before possible to Shakespeare's plays as they were first acted.

Along with an authoritative text of a major literary work, each volume presents critical essays, selected or prepared especially for students, that approach the work from several contemporary critical perspectives, such as gender criticism and cultural studies. Each essay is accompanied by an introduction (with bibliography) to the history, principles, and practice of its critical perspective. Every volume also surveys the biographical, historical, and critical contexts of the literary work and concludes with a glossary of critical terms. New editions reprint cultural documents that contextualize the literary works and feature essays that show how critical perspectives can be combined.</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>WHEN RAIN CLOUDS GATHER</h2><p>The poverty-striken village of Golema Mmidi, in the heart of rural Botswana, is a haven to the exiles gathered there. When a political refugee from South Africa joins forces with an English agricultural expert, the time-honoured subsistence farming is challenged.</p><p>Bessie Head, one of Africa&#39;s best known writers, was born in South Africa but spent much of her life in Botswana. She died tragically early, in 1986, leaving behind her a fine collection of literary works. Tales of Tenderness and Power was the first of her works to be published after her death, and another anthology, A Woman Alone, has also been published posthumously. Both these titles reinforce Bessie Head&#39;s literary achievements, already evident in her novels Maru, When Rain clouds Gather, The Cardinals, A Collector of Treasures, A Question of Power, and her historical account Serowe: Village of the Rain Wind, which are all available in the Heinemann African Writer Series."I am grateful that Waveland has provided reliable editions of Bessie Head's works, especially <i>When Rain Clouds Gather.</i> The notes and glossary are helpful to first-time readers. The overall quality and price of these editions make them an excellent choice for my courses." --Melisa Klimaszewski, Drake University</p><h2>House of Mirth</h2><p>Born in 1862 into an exclusive New York society -- against whose rigid mores she often rebelled -- Edith Wharton bridged the literary worlds of two continents and two centuries in her rich and glamorous life. The House of Mirth (1905), her tenth book, is the story of young Lily Bart and her tragic sojourn among the upper class of turn-of-the-century New York, touching upon the insidious effects of social convention and the sexual and financial aggression to which free spirited women exposed</p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Course in Econometrics</h2><p><p>This text prepares first-year graduate students and advanced undergraduates for empirical research in economics, and also equips them for specialization in econometric theory, business, and sociology.</p><p><i>A Course in Econometrics</i> is likely to be the text most thoroughly attuned to the needs of your students. Derived from the course taught by Arthur S. Goldberger at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison and at Stanford University, it is specifically designed for use over two semesters, offers students the most thorough grounding in introductory statistical inference, and offers a substantial amount of interpretive material. The text brims with insights, strikes a balance between rigor and intuition, and provokes students to form their own critical opinions.</p><p><i>A Course in Econometrics</i> thoroughly covers the fundamentals&#x2015;classical regression and simultaneous equations&#x2015;and offers clear and logical explorations of asymptotic theory and nonlinear regression. To accommodate students with various levels of preparation, the text opens with a thorough review of statistical concepts and methods, then proceeds to the regression model and its variants. Bold subheadings introduce and highlight key concepts throughout each chapter.</p><p>Each chapter concludes with a set of exercises specifically designed to reinforce and extend the material covered. Many of the exercises include real microdata analyses, and all are ideally suited to use as homework and test questions.</p></p><p>Arthur S. Goldberger was Professor of Economics, Emeritus, at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.&#x201c;This book is an excellent choice for first year graduate econometrics courses because it provides a solid foundation in statistical reasoning in a manner that is both clear and concise. It addresses a number of issues that are of central importance to developing practitioners and theorists alike and achieves this in a fairly nontechnical manner... The topics addressed here are rarely given such a thorough treatment in econometrics textbooks. For example, in discussions of bivariate distributions, Goldberger points out that two uncorrelated normal random variables may not be independent, since a nonnormal bivariate distribution can generate normal marginal distributions. Other texts typically leave readers with the impression that two uncorrelated normal random variables are independent without reference to their joint distribution... <i>A Course in Econometrics</i> is rigorous, it makes students think hard about important issues, and it avoids a cookbook approach. For these reasons, I strongly recommend it as a basic text for all first year graduate econometrics courses.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Douglas G. Steigerwald</b><b>, </b><b><i>Econometric Theory</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>A Course in Econometrics</i>] strike[s] the right balance between mathematical rigour and intuitive feel. It aims to prepare students for empirical research but also those who go on to more advanced econometrics... The book is very clear and very precise. It is built on just a few very simple concepts. I think that students will like it very much. I congratulate Professor Goldberger with having written a very useful book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jan R. Magnus</b><b>, </b><b><i>Economic Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Undoubtedly the best Ph.D. level econometrics textbook available today.

Gatwood&#39;s poems deftly deconstruct traditional stereotypes. The focus shifts from childhood to adulthood, gender to sexuality, violence to joy.

As a playwright, he ranks in popularity second only to Shakespeare in the English-speaking world. As a prose writer, he was one of the first to use the stream-of-consciousness technique, and his anti-heroic realism, full of ambiguity and allusion, provides no easy moral conclusions and results in a new kind of narrative approaching real life in a way no writer had achieved before him.<p>&#x201c;As a work of literature,<i> Sakhalin Island</i> is a masterpiece of restrained, dignified, unsentimental prose ... a work of complete seriousness, full of clear, humane, practical suggestions for reform.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mr Reeve's work reminds one that Chekhov was as great a master of the documentary genre &#x2013; and also of the best academic prose &#x2013; as of drama and narrative fiction ...<i> Sakhalin Island</i> will never eclipse <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>.

To correct these and other&nbsp;&nbsp;misperceptions about James, Scripture scholar Luke Timothy&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson embarks on a thorough history of the&nbsp;&nbsp;interpretation of this pivotal letter, which highlights the&nbsp;&nbsp;vast appreciation for James over the centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the question of who wrote the letter&nbsp;&nbsp;of James, Johnson boldly identifies the writer as&nbsp;&nbsp;none other than James, the brother of Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ. While modern skepticism casts doubt on this&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion, early textual witnesses, as well as saints&nbsp;&nbsp;and scholars throughout the centuries, corroborate&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson's position. A thorough examination of the&nbsp;&nbsp;original language texts and an explanation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;literary context of James helps illuminate the&nbsp;&nbsp;original meaning of the letter. In addition, Johnson&nbsp;&nbsp;offers the general reader insights into the&nbsp;&nbsp;letter's relevance for today.</p><p><p>LUKE TIMOTHY JOHNSON is Professor of New Testament at the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

Over the centuries, the vision of directors like Welles, Nunn and Polanski, as well as the eloquent talents of actors like Garrick, Siddons, Olivier and McKellen have contributed to the central debate of the play: Who or what is culpable?

Although reciprocal teaching originally was designed for use with struggling readers, author Lori D. Oczkus offers innovative lessons aimed at improving the reading comprehension of all students. Reciprocal Teaching at Work: Strategies for Improving Reading Comprehension provides a practical classroom resource on reciprocal teaching that readers will find accessible and engaging. Chapter 1 describes each reciprocal teaching strategy in detail and suggests ways that teachers can overcome both difficulties that they may encounter when using this teaching technique and common problems that students have with using the strategies. Chapters 2&#x2013;4 explain how to use reciprocal teaching in whole-class sessions, guided reading groups, and literature circles, respectively. Each of these chapters offers scaffolded lessons, minilessons, and reproducible forms for classroom teachers to use with students, and reflection questions for staff development. The appendixes provide a list of what teachers should observe when students work with the reciprocal teaching strategies, a student self-assessment for strategy usage, and instructions for conducting informal assessment interviews with students. This book will benefit classroom teachers and reading specialists working primarily with students in grades 2&#x2013;6, and teacher educators, school administrators, and staff developers seeking successful reading comprehension strategies to share with teachers.<p>The International Reading Association is the world's premier organization of literacy professionals.

He is the board vice president of the Society for Classical Learning and the director of the Alcuin Fellowship of classical educators. He has published numerous articles and lectures that are widely used throughout the United States and the English-speaking world.The objections to classical education are that it is too harsh or demanding, too focused on rote drilling, too impractical, lacking in extracurricular opportunities, and, while it may be fine for future study of the humanities, it is insufficient preparation for study of the sciences. Perrin answers each of these objections in turn, but a more sustained argument (one with studies and statistics) is probably necessary for convincing a skeptic.<br>The pamphlet is clear, to the point, well organized, and easy to read. --S. Burris, GoodReads</p><h2>Old New Land</h2><p>**New Introduction by Jacques Kornberg** Old New Land forever altered the face of the Middle East. The book was a nineteenth-century utopian blueprint for a modern state of Israel. There were Jewish settlers in Palestine, and Zionist ideas had existed in Eastern Europe before Herzl, but Herzl made Zionism into a cultural and political movement acceptable to Western governments and intellectuals. His prophecy at the end of this book became reality: "If you will it, it is not a fable." The author, founder of the Zionist movement, considered this utopian story his best literary work: an expression of his art, with a political message. <p>His biographer, Amos Elon, placed Old New Land "in the mainstream of fin-de-siecle art. Its pursuit of arcadian bliss within a mystic community and its haunted preoccupation with dreams recall Gustav Mahler's music."</p></p><p>About Theodor Herzl: Theodor Herzl lived most of his life in Vienna as a star journalist and successful author.

Turner, Winslow Homer, and other masters of this difficult medium. Watercolor was more than a distraction from the portrait and mural commissions Sargent labored over; after 1900, watercolor became central to his artistic vision. His aquarelles are, simply stated, masterworks. Portraits, interiors, landscapes, architectural studies&#x2014;Sargent's work in watercolor offers a great variety of subject matter, ranging from Arab gypsies to World War I soldiers, to masterful depictions of Venetian churches, to Florida swamp alligators.<br><br>Sargent carried his watercolors on his travels; They were ideally suited to capturing the scene, the light, the air, wherever he found himself. This book serves as a record of his travels, featuring the paintings he produced in Palestine, Northern Africa, the Canadian Rockies, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, and Greece. Among specific locales were the islands of Majorca and Corfu; Florence, Venice, Carrara, Lake Garda, and Rome; the Alps; Lake O'Hara; the coast of Maine and the Miami River.<br><br>Sargent's bold and often experimental use of the medium, which sometimes led to semi-abstract images, compels admiration among contemporary painters as well as museum goers today. In addition to placing Sargent's accomplishments in the context of his life and time, Carl Little discusses the artist's extraordinary watercolor technique.</p><p><b>Carl Little</b> is the author of <i>Edward Hopper's New England</i> (1993) and <i>Winslow Homer: His Art, His Light, His Landscapes</i> (1997).

He has lectured at the Portland Museum of Art and the Farnsworth Art Museum in Maine.</p><h2>Jay DeFeo and The Rose</h2><p>Rarely is an artist so closely associated with a single work as is Jay DeFeo with her monumental painting <i>The Rose.</i> Begun in the late 1950s, when DeFeo, a central figure of the Beat generation of San Francisco, was just starting to garner widespread national recognition, the visionary work occupied the artist for eight years. Massive in scale, layered with nearly two thousand pounds of paint, the overpowering painting was already famous before its first exhibition in 1969 at the Pasadena Art Museum. It was next exhibited in San Francisco, then stored at the San Francisco Art Institute, where it languished for twenty-five years before a historic conservation restored it to public view. <i>The Rose</i> now resides in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.<br><br>This volume is the first major study of <i>The Rose</i> in particular and of Jay DeFeo in general. In the collection, eleven distinguished art and cultural historians&#x2015;Bill Berkson, Niccolo Caldararo, Richard C�ndida Smith, Walter Hopps, Lucy R. Lippard, Greil Marcus, Sandra S. Phillips, Marla Prather, Carter Ratcliff, David A. Ross, and Martha Sherrill&#x2015;unfold the story of the creation, as well as the tricky and painstaking rescue, of DeFeo&#x2019;s radiant masterpiece. While providing new material on <i>The Rose</i> and exposing many myths surrounding both the artist and her great work, these essays also place Jay DeFeo in relation to artists of her time, including Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Lee Bontecou, and Eva Hesse. The book, which adds significantly to the scholarship of postwar American art, includes nearly eighty halftones, thirteen color plates, and Judith Dunham&#x2019;s detailed <i>Rose</i>-related chronology.</p><p>"A gorgeous and moving book about a grand American masterpiece."&#x2015;Thomas Hoving<br><br>"Is The Rose erupting or imploding, or is it doing both simultaneously&#x2015;swallowing up and disgorging a life, an era, an entire mythos? The current volume, at last grappling with the whole of Jay DeFeo's great billowing fever dream of a masterpiece, plugs a gaping hole in the history of contemporary American art, and does so with a sense of moment and scale and flair worthy of its mind-blowing subject."&#x2015;Lawrence Weschler<br><br>"An original and highly effective combining of 'readings' of the work of Jay DeFeo, a leading figure of the Beat generation. The various perspectives of the authors come smoothly together in their recognition of her supreme artistic ambition and desire to approach transcendence through art. New images and insights demythologize <i>The Rose,</i> now a genuine icon of the heroic abstract expressionist ethos identified with the era, enabling its creator to emerge as an individual and thereby richly enhancing our understanding of both the art and the artist."&#x2015;Paul J. Karlstrom, editor of <i>On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art, 1900-1950</i><br><br>"Eight years in the making, Jay DeFeo's The Rose was hidden behind a wall for over two decades and uncovered only after the artist's death. This book presents an account of its remarkable birth, burial, rescue, and resurrection through the words of conservators, curators, art historians, friends of the artist, and critics. The volume's sensitively written essays bring <i>The Rose</i> back to life in all its enigmatic complexity. It is a story unparalleled in contemporary art history, by turns riveting, heartbreaking, and exhilarating."&#x2015;Eleanor Heartney, author of <i>Critical Condition: American Culture at the Crossroads</i><b>Jane Green </b>is an art historian and has worked on exhibitions at Mills College Art Museum and the Berkeley Art Museum, two institutions associated with DeFeo. <b>Leah Levy </b>is an independent curator and trustee of the Estate of Jay DeFeo.

Good provides plenty of practical tips about what she calls a near miracle appliance. For example, take time to get acquainted with a new slow cooker, fill it two-thirds full for best results, and try out recipes for the first time when at home for the day. And she dispels two big myths: that her beloved machine is a winter-time appliance and that it&#x2019;s mainly just for beef stew. Fuggedaboutit. True, many of the 250 recipes are for main dishes made with chicken, turkey, pork, or beef. But she gives even more space to pasta, soups, quiches, appetizers, breakfasts, breads, and desserts. Why not wake up to steel-cut oatmeal that&#x2019;s been slow cooking overnight? The slow cooker can even bake peach cobbler or a fudgy chocolate cake. Each recipe comes with a photo, some (such as mashed potatoes) get a quick and easy label, and several get a bonus tip from Good (such as cooking wine is wine with salt added). With good recipes and good vibes, the latest Fix-It and Forget-It cookbook is bound to be a best-seller. --Karen Springen</p><h2>Century of Struggle: The Woman&#39;s Rights Movement in the United States, Enlarged Edition</h2><p><p><i>Century of Struggle</i> tells the story of one of the great social movements in American history.

In this adventurous tale, learn about Kagame&#x2019;s early fascination with Che Guevara and James Bond, his years as an intelligence agent, his training in Cuba and the United States, the way he built his secret rebel army, his bloody rebellion, and his outsized ambitions for Rwanda.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008</b>: Fourteen years after the 1994 genocide that claimed 800,000 lives in 100 days, Rwandans continue the daily work of rebuilding their shattered country. In light of recent reports that one in four people suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder--which Rwandans aptly describe as <i>ihahamuka</i> or "breathless with fear"--how is recovery even possible? In search of answers, foreign correspondent Stephen Kinzer traveled extensively throughout Rwanda where he observed an astonishing economic and political transformation based surprisingly on Asian models, and the implementation of unconventional reconciliation efforts. The author also conducted extensive interviews with Rwanda's enigmatic president, Paul Kagame. The result of Kinzer's quest is <i>A Thousand Hills</i>, a page-turning story of a society desperately trying to regain its breath, and an ambitious and autocratic leader's unrelenting efforts to breathe life into its future. This is essential reading, even if you've read earlier accounts by Canadian general Rom�o Dallaire, journalists Phillip Gourevitch and Samantha Power, and the heroic Paul Rusesabagina immortalized in the film <i>Hotel Rwanda</i>. --<i>Lauren Nemroff</i>In 1994, the world stood idly by as Rwanda was devastated by the most horrifying genocide since the Holocaust. Now this tiny, land-locked nation stands poised to stun the world again&#x2014;but in a very different way. Killers and survi-vors have embarked on a breathtaking path toward reconciliation, and Rwanda has become one of the most promising countries in the developing world. How did this happen?<p>In A <i>Thousand Hills</i>, bestselling author Stephen Kinzer tells the dramatic story of Paul Kagame, whose rebel army stopped the genocide and whose government has turned Rwanda into a new star of Africa. Kagame grew up as a wretched refugee, shaped one of the most audacious covert operations in the history of clandestine warfare, and then emerged as a visionary leader with radical ideas about how poor countries can climb out of their misery. Whether his experiment can succeed is a question that has begun to fascinate people across Africa and beyond.</p><p>A <i>Thousand Hills</i> tells Kagame's astonishing story more fully than it has ever been told before. Drawingon extensive interviews with Kagame himself and with people who knew him at every stage of his life, Kinzer recounts one of the great untold stories of modern revolution. He traces Kagame through his years as a bitterly angry student, recounts his early fascination with men of action ranging from Che Guevara to James Bond, and explains how he built a secret revolutionary army in a way no one ever had before. With the dramatic flair that has led the <i>Washington Post</i> to call him "among the best in foreign policy storytelling," Kinzer then traces the three-and-a-half-year war Kagame waged in the Rwandan bush&#x2014;a war that stopped a genocide, changed the destiny of a nation, and set in motion one of the most exciting social and political experiments now under way anywhere in the world.</p><p>Filled with harrowing tales of guerilla warfare, heart-wrenching accounts of the genocide carried out by the government of Rwanda, and inspiring stories of how a devastated nation can reinvent itself, A <i>Thousand Hills</i> is powerful, moving, and deeply compelling.</p></p><h2>Soulprint</h2><p><p>Seventeen-year-old Alina Chase has spent her entire life imprisoned on a secluded island&#x2015;not for a crime she committed in this lifetime, but one done by her past self.

Thousands of years later, this ancient knowledge was brutally suppressed by the early Catholic church and ignored by science. But it still lingered on, kept by such secret societies as the Knights Templar and the Masons, who designed buildings and whole cities incorporating this esoteric knowledge, hidden in plan view. Here, Cowan brings together his own extensive work with the findings of other researchers, and reveals his discovery that the energy lines emanate from volcanic sources that spew out natural telluric energies in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel! Chapters include: Megalithic Engineering; Burial Grounds across Scotland; Following a Straight Ley Line to its Source; Saint Columba and Iona; The Royal Triangle of Great Britain; The Strange Behavior of Ley Lines; The Dance of the Dragon; Ley Lines in the USA; The Secret Knowledge of the Freemasons; Spirit Paths; The Occult Knowledge of the Nazis; How to Use Diving Rods; The Amazing Power of the Maze; more.

With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to "mastery learning," abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now.<br><br>More than just a solution, THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.</p><p>Salman Khan was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana, to immigrant parents from India and Bangladesh. Before founding the Khan Academy, he was a hedge fund analyst. He&#39;s also worked in venture capital and engineering at Oracle and several Silicon Valley start-ups. Khan holds an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he was president of his class, and three degrees from MIT."Since its founding in 2006, Sal Khan's project-the Khan academy-has revolutionized our thinking on the potential and promise of unfettered, open-access online education. In his new book The One World Schoolhouse, Khan presents his vision and blueprint for how online technology can, and should, play an integral role in educating communities across the globe, closing the opportunity gap and providing high-quality education for all."&#x2015;<b><i>Al Gore</i></b><br><br>"In this book, Salman Khan sheds light on how our current education system leaves a gap in every student's core knowledge. He found ways to fill this gap by encouraging differentness, fresh thinking and implementing creativity in the learning process. I strongly believe that all human beings have unlimited creative power. The role of education is to unleash that power. The way he relates the proper goal of education and the natural bent of the child is fascinating. He refers "natural bent" as the particular mix of talents and perspectives that makes each mind unique, and allows minds to be strikingly original. The way Khan portrays the concept of education and the mechanism of learning is revolutionary. This book is a must-read for those providing real education to our children in this new age of technology."&#x2015;<b><i>Muhammed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, and the 2006 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</i></b><br><br>"Sal Khan's passion and innovation is transforming learning for millions of students worldwide. The One World School is a must-read for all who are committed to improving education so students everywhere can gain the skills and knowledge to be successful in school, careers and life."&#x2015;<b><i>George Lucas, Filmmaker and Founder of The George Lucas Educational Foundation, publisher of Edutopia</i></b><br><br>"I discovered Sal Khan and Khan Academy like most other people - by using these incredible tools with my own kids. Sal Khan's vision and energy for how technology could fundamentally transform education is contagious. He's a true pioneer in integrating technology and learning. I'm happy that, through this book, even more people will be introduced to this ground-breaking innovator."&#x2015;<b><i>Bill Gates, co-founder &amp; Chairman, Microsoft</i></b><br><br>"The world dreams of education reform, and Sal Khan is delivering. His pioneering video lessons have brought the thrill of learning to millions. In this compelling book, he tells the remarkable story of Khan Academy, and explains the potential in students learning at their own pace and achieving true subject mastery."&#x2015;<b><i>Chris Anderson, TED Curator</i></b><br><br>"Sal Khan makes a powerful argument for fundamentally rethinking the way we teach and learn. THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE illuminates the tremendous potential for online, universaleducation to enable any child, anywhere in the world, to succeed-not only in school, but in shaping our future."&#x2015;<b><i>Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google</i></b><br><br>"Sal Khan is changing what we believe is possible in education. Through humor, charm, contagious enthusiasm and quiet brilliance, Sal Khan has made his lessons irresistible. Now, he brings those same gifts to explaining the revolutionary ideas behind Khan Academy. You'll adore this book because it's just like his lessons-approachable, good-hearted, smart, and ultimately profound. The story Sal tells is quite simply the story of what education will become... and indeed IS becoming, thanks to his example and to a generation of inspired teachers and intrepid education entrepreneurs."&#x2015;<b><i>Ted Mitchell, President and CEO, NewSchools Venture Fund</i></b><br><br>"When you read this book, you will understand how the dignity of each student is addressed by education's visionary, Sal Khan."&#x2015;<b><i>Ann Doerr</i></b><br><br>"Sal Khan has developed the best and most cost-efficient way to use technology to bring high quality education, creativity and innovation to all countries, including the poorest."&#x2015;<b><i>Carlos Slim Helu</i></b></p><h2>Essential of Electronics, 2nd Edition</h2><p>This highly illustrated text, activities manual, and instructor&#39;s guide package is designed for use in a survey of electronics course for non-majors.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

Additionally, it covers areas that are not well-covered in some other analogous texts (women of color, older people of color, multicultural gays and lesbians, impact of spirituality, etc.) The book really heightens consciousness and awareness of how diversity infiltrates every aspect of social work practice and needs to be considered at all times."</p><h2>Stop Acting Rich: ...And Start Living Like A Real Millionaire</h2><p><b>The bestselling author of <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i> reveals easy ways to build real wealth</b> <p>With well over two million of his books sold, and huge praise from many media outlets, Dr. Thomas J. Stanley is a recognized and highly respected authority on how the wealthy act and think. Now, in Stop Acting Rich ? and Start Living Like a Millionaire, he details how the less affluent have fallen into the elite luxury brand trap that keeps them from acquiring wealth and details how to get out of it by emulating the working rich as opposed to the super elite.</p> <ul> <li>Puts wealth in perspective and shows you how to live rich without spending more</li> <li>Details why we spend lavishly and how to stop this destructive cycle</li> <li>Discusses how being "rich" means more than just big houses and luxury cars</li> </ul> <p>A defensive strategy for tough times, Stop Acting Rich shows readers how to live a rich, happy life through accumulating more wealth and using it to achieve the type of financial freedom that will create true happiness and fulfillment.</p></p><p>With the financial crisis, high unemployment, and tight credit, you may be saying to yourself: who is acting rich these days? We're barely making ends meet. <p>You would think that our wastrel ways are over, we're erasing debt, and stocking up on savings. The reality is that not only are we spenders who barely understand the concept of frugality, we are big spenders on expensive elite brands, and we do it in an attempt to emulate the rich people we see on television, in magazines, and down the street. The recession may have caused us to take a breather, but every indication is that we will pick up right where we left off when gentler economic winds blow again.</p> <p>Before you spend another dime, read this book and understand how to become rich instead of act rich. <i>Stop Acting Rich . . . And Start Living Like a Real Millionaire</i> will upend every assumption you have about wealthy people: where they shop, what they buy, and most shockingly, where they live (it's not where you think).</p> <p>Did you know that three times more millionaires live in homes valued at under $300,000 than over $1 million? Would it stun you to learn that more millionaires drive Toyotas than BMWs? How about a second home? Not for the millionaire.</p> <p>Bestselling author of <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i> and <i>The Millionaire Mind</i> and leading authority on the wealthy, Dr. Thomas Stanley uncovers the truth about spending to show you how you can really live rich.</p> <p>It all starts with where you live. Live in a prestige neigh?borhood and you will spend more on everything from your car to your watch. Real millionaires understand that living in communities where their neighbors have less net worth than they do naturally leads to spending less. It's easier to be rich when keeping up with the Joneses hardly costs anything.</p> <p>Dr. Stanley's research also uncovers what makes rich people happy. Life satisfaction comes not from cruising down the highway in a chunk of your net worth, but from having the financial resources to choose&#x2014;to spend time with family and friends, to volunteer, to pursue interests.</p> <p><i>Stop Acting Rich . . . And Start Living Like a Real Millionaire</i> rips the lid off just about every assumption we have about what rich looks like. Few people become rich by way of a high income, and even fewer high-income people are truly rich. The good news is that almost anyone can become wealthy&#x2014;even without a super high income&#x2014;if you would just stop acting . . . and instead start living like a rich person.</p><p><b>PRAISE FORSTOP ACTING RICH. . . AND START LIVING LIKE A REAL MILLIONAIRE</b></p> <p>"Stanley's research does a great job of proving there's a big differencebetween income and net worth. Many pretenders have become very good atgenerating income and enjoying a high standard of living. But take this Stanleygem to the bank: 'Those who are among the least productive in transformingtheir incomes into wealth are in the higher-status occupations.'

A new chapter on differential equations appears immediately after the chapter on techniques of integration. It includes both direction fields and Euler's method, together with the more symbolic elementary methods and applications for both first- and second-order equations. Linear systems and matrices through determinants and eigenvalues are now introduced in Chapter 11. The subsequent multivariable chapters now integrate matrix methods and terminology with traditional multivariable calculus (e.g., the chain rule in matrix form). The CD-ROM accompanying the book contains a functional array of fully integrated learning resources linked to individual sections of the book. The user can view any desired book section in PDF format. </p></p><p><p> <b> <i>C. Henry Edwards</i></b><i> </i> is emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee in 1960, and recently retired after 40 years of classroom teaching (including calculus or differential equations almost every term) at the universities of Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Georgia, with a brief interlude at the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. He has received numerous teaching awards, including the University of Georgia's <i>honoratus</i> medal in 1983 (for sustained excellence in honors teaching), its Josiah Meigs award in 1991 (the institution's highest award for teaching), and the 1997 state-wide Georgia Regents award for research university faculty teaching excellence. His scholarly career has ranged from research and dissertation direction in topology to the history of mathematics to computing and technology in the teaching and applications of mathematics. In addition to being author or co-author of calculus, advanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations textbooks, he is well-known to calculus instructors as author of <i>The Historical Development of the Calculus</i> (Springer-Verlag, 1979). During the 1990s he served as a principal investigator on three NSF-supported projects: (1) A school mathematics project including Maple for beginning algebra students, (2) A Calculus-with-<i>Mathematica</i> program, and (3) A MATLAB-based computer lab project for numerical analysis and differential equations students. </p> <p> <b> <i>David E. Penney,</i></b><i> </i> University of Georgia, completed his Ph.D. at Tulane University in 1965 (under the direction of Prof. L. Bruce Treybig) while teaching at the University of New Orleans. Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects. He is the author of research papers in number theory and topology and is the author or co-author of textbooks on calculus, computer programming, differential equations, linear algebra, and liberal arts mathematics. </p><p> Contemporary calculus instructors and students face traditional challenges as well as new ones that result from changes in the role and practice of mathematics by scientists and engineers in the world at large. As a consequence, this sixth edition of our calculus textbook is its most extensive revision since the first edition appeared in 1982. </p> <p> Two entire chapters of the fifth edition have been replaced in the table of contents by two new ones; most of the remaining chapters have been extensively rewritten. Nearly 160 of the book's over 800 worked examples are new for this edition and the 1854 figures in the text include 250 new computer-generated graphics. Almost 800 of its 7250 problems are new, and these are augmented by over 330 new conceptual discussion questions that now precede the problem sets. Moreover, almost 1100 new true/false questions are included in the Study Guides on the new CD-ROM that accompanies this edition. In summary, almost 2200 of these 8650-plus problems and questions are new, and the text discussion and explanations have undergone corresponding alteration and improvement. </p> <p><b>PRINCIPAL NEW FEATURES</b></p> <p> The current revision of the text features </p> <ul> <li> <b>Early transcendentals</b> fully integrated in Semester I.</li> <li> <b>Differential equations</b> and applications in Semester II.</li> <li> <b>Linear systems and matrices</b> in Semester III.</li> </ul> <p> Complete coverage of the calculus of transcendental functions is now fully integrated in Chapters 1 through 6&#x2014;with the result that the Chapter 7 and 8 titles in the 5th edition table of contents do pot appear in this 6th edition. </p> <p> A new chapter on differential equations (Chapter 8) now appears immediately` after Chapter 7 on techniques of integration. It includes both direction fields and Eider's method together with the more elementary symbolic methods (which exploit techniques from Chapter 7) and interesting applications of both first- and second-order equations. Chapter 10 (Infinite Series) now ends with a new section on power series solutions of differential equations, thus bringing full circle a unifying focus of second-semester calculus on elementary differential equations. </p> <p> Linear systems and matrices, ending with an elementary treatment of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, are now introduced in Chapter 11. The subsequent coverage of multivariable calculus now integrates matrix methods and terminology with the traditional notation and approach&#x2014;including (for instance) introduction and extensive application of the chain rule in matrix-product form. </p> <p><b>NEW LEARNING RESOURCES</b></p> <p> <b>Conceptual Discussion Questions.</b> The set of problems that concludes each section is now preceded by a brief <b>Concepts: Questions and Discussion</b> set consisting of several open-ended conceptual questions that can be used for either individual study or classroom discussion. </p> <p> <b>The Text CD-ROM.</b> The content of the new CD-ROM that accompanies this text is fully integrated with the textbook material, and is designed specifically for use hand-in-hand with study of the book itself. This CD-ROM features the following resources to support learning and teaching: </p> <ul> <li> <b>Interactive True/False Study Guides</b> that reinforce and encourage student reading of the text. Ten author-written questions for each section carefully guide students through the section, and students can request individual hints suggesting where in the section to look for needed information.</li> <li> <b>Live Examples</b> feature dynamic multimedia and computer algebra presentations&#x2014;many accompanied by audio explanations&#x2014;which enhance student intuition and understanding. These interactive examples expand upon many of the textbook's principal examples; students can change input data and conditions and then observe the resulting changes in step-by-step solutions and accompanying graphs and figures. <b>Walkthrough videos</b> demonstrate how students can interact with these live examples.</li> <li> <b>Homework Starters</b> for the principal types of computational problems in each textbook section, featuring both interactive presentations similar to the live examples and (web-linked) voice-narrated videos of pencil-and-paper investigations illustrating typical initial steps in the solution of selected textbook problems.</li> <li> <b>Computing Project Resources</b> support most of the over three dozen projects that follow key sections in the text. For each such project marked in the text by a CD-ROM icon, more extended discussions illustrating Maple, <i>Mathematica,</i> MATLAB, and graphing calculator investigations are provided. Computer algebra system commands can be copied and pasted for interactive execution.</li> <li> <b>Hyperlinked Maple Worksheets</b> contributed by Harald Pleym of Telemark University College (Norway) constitute an interactive version of essentially the whole textbook. Students and faculty using Maple can change input data and conditions in most of the text examples to investigate the resulting changes in step-by-step solutions and accompanying graphs and figures.</li> <li> <b>PowerPoint Presentations</b> provide classroom projection versions of about 350 of the figures in the text that would be least convenient to reproduce on a blackboard.</li> <li> <b>Website.</b> The contents of the CD-ROM together with additional learning and teaching resources are maintained and updated at the textbook website <b>www.prenhall.com/edwards</b> , which includes a Comments and Suggestions center where we invite response from both students and instructors.</li> </ul> <p> <b>Computerized Homework Grading System.</b> About 2000 of the textbook problems are incorporated in an automated grading system that is now available. Each problem solution in the system is structured algorithmically so that students can work in a computer lab setting to submit homework assignments for automatic grading. (There is a small annual fee per participating student.) </p> <p> <b>New Solutions Manuals.</b> The entirely new 1900-page <b>Instructor's Solutions Manual</b> (available in two volumes) includes a detailed solution for every problem in the book. These solutions were written exclusively by the authors and have been checked independently by others. </p> <p> The entirely new 950-page <b>Student Solutions Manual</b> (available in two volumes) includes a detailed solution for every odd-numbered problem in the text. The answers (alone) to most of these odd-numbered problems are included in the answers section at the back of this book. </p> <p> <b>New Technology Manuals.</b> Each of the following manuals is available shrink-wrapped with any version of the text for half the normal price of the manual (all of which are inexpensive): </p> <ul> <li>Jensen, <i>Using MATLAB in Calculus</i> (0-13-027268-X)</li> <li>Freese/Stegenga, <i>Calculus Concepts Using Derive</i> (0-13-085152-3)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>TI Graphing Calculator Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092017-7)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>A Mathematica Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092015-0)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>A Maple Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092014-2)</li> </ul> <p><b>THE TEXT IN MORE DETAIL . . .</b></p> <p> In preparing this edition, we have taken advantage of many valuable comments and suggestions from users of the first five editions. This revision was so pervasive that the individual changes are too numerous to be detailed in a preface, but the following paragraphs summarize those that may be of widest interest. </p> <ul> <li> <b>New Problems.</b> Most of the almost 800 new problems lie in the intermediate range of difficulty, neither highly theoretical nor computationally routine. Many of them have a new technology flavor, suggesting (if not requiring) the use of technology ranging from a graphing calculator to a computer algebra system.</li> <li> <b>Discussion Questions and Study Guides.</b> We hope the 330 conceptual discussion questions and 1080 true/false study-guide questions constitute a useful addition to the traditional fare of student exercises and problems. The True/False Study Guide for each section provides a focus on the key ideas of the section, with the single goal of motivating guided student reading of the section.</li> <li> <b>Examples and Explanations.</b> About 20% of the book's worked examples are either new or significantly revised, together with a similar percentage of the text discussion and explanations. Additional computational detail has been inserted in worked examples where students have experienced difficulty, together with additional sentences and paragraphs in similar spots in text discussions.</li> <li> <b>Project Material.</b> Many of the text's almost 40 projects are new for this edition. These appear following the problem sets at the ends of key sections throughout the text. Most (but not all) of these projects employ some aspect of modern computational technology to illustrate the principal ideas of the preceding section, and many contain additional problems intended for solution with the use of a graphing calculator or computer algebra system. Where appropriate, project discussions are significantly expanded in the CD-ROM versions of the projects.</li> <li> <b>Historical Material.</b> Historical and biographical chapter openings offer students a sense of the development of our subject by real human beings. Indeed, our exposition of calculus frequently reflects the historical development of the subject&#x2014;from ancient times to the ages of Newton and Leibniz and Euler to our own era of new computational power and technology.</li> </ul> <p><b>TEXT ORGANIZATION</b></p> <ul> <li> <b>Introductory Chapters.</b> Instead of a routine review of precalculus topics, Chapter 1 concentrates specifically on functions and graphs for use in mathematical modeling. It includes a section cataloging informally the elementary transcendental functions of calculus, as background to their more formal treatment using calculus itself. Chapter 1 concludes with a section addressing the question "What is calculus?" Chapter 2 on limits begins with a section on tangent lines to motivate the official introduction of limits in Section 2.2. Trigonometric limits are treated throughout Chapter 2 in order to encourage a richer and more visual introduction to the limit concept.</li> <li> <b>Differentiation.</b> Chapters The sequence of topics in Chapters 3 and 4 differs a bit from the most traditional order. We attempt to build student confidence by introducing topics more nearly in order of increasing difficulty. The chain rule appears quite early (in Section 3.3) and we cover the basic techniques for differentiating algebraic functions before discussing maxima and minima in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. Section 3.7 treats the derivatives of all six trigonometric functions, and Section 3.8 (much strengthened for this edition) introduces the exponential and logarithmic functions. Implicit differentiation and related rates are combined in a single section (Section 3.9). The authors' fondness for Newton's method (Section 3.10) will be apparent. <br> <br> The mean value theorem and its applications are deferred to Chapter 4. In addition, a dominant theme of Chapter 4 is the use of calculus both to construct graphs of functions and to explain and interpret graphs that have been constructed by a calculator or computer. This theme is developed in Sections 4.4 on the first derivative test and 4.6 on higher derivatives and concavity. But it may also be apparent in Sections 4.8 and 4.9 on 1'H6pital's rule, which now appears squarely in the context of differential calculus and is applied here to round out the calculus of exponential and logarithmic functions.</li> <li> <b>Integration Chapters.</b> Chapter 5 begins with a section on antiderivatives&#x2014;which could logically be included in the preceding chapter, but benefits from the use of integral notation. When the definite integral is introduced in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, we emphasize endpoint and midpoint sums rather than upper and lower and more general Riemann sums. This concrete emphasis carries through the chapter to its final section on numerical integration. <br> <br> Chapter 6 begins with a largely new section on Riemann sum approximations, with new examples centering on fluid flow and medical applications. Section 6.6 is a new treatment of centroids of plane regions and curves. Section 6.7 gives the integral approach to logarithms, and Sections 6.8 and 6.9 cover both the differential and the integral calculus of inverse trigonometric functions and of hyperbolic functions. <br> <br> Chapter 7 (Techniques of Integration) is organized to accommodate those instructors who feel that methods of formal integration now require less emphasis, in view of modern techniques for both numerical and symbolic integration. Integration by parts (Section 7.3) precedes trigonometric integrals (Section 7.4). The method of partial fractions appears in Section 7.5, and trigonometric substitutions and integrals involving quadratic polynomials follow in Sections 7.6 and 7.7. Improper integrals appear in Section 7.8, with new and substantial subsections on special functions and probability and random sampling. This rearrangement of Chapter 7 makes it more convenient to stop wherever the instructor desires.</li> <li> <b>Differential Equations.</b> This entirely new chapter begins with the most elementary differential equations and applications (Section 8.1) and then proceeds to introduce both graphical (slope field) and numerical (Eider) methods in Section 8.2. Subsequent sections of the chapter treat separable and linear first-order differential equations and (in more depth than usual in a calculus course) applications such as population growth (including logistic and predator-prey populations) and motion with resistance. The final two sections of Chapter 8 treat second-order linear equations and applications to mechanical vibrations. Instructors desiring still more coverage of differential equations can arrange with the publisher to bundle and use appropriate sections of Edwards and Penney, <b>Differential Equations: Computing and Modeling 2/e</b> (Prentice Hall, 2000).</li> <li> <b>Parametric Curves and Polar Coordinates.</b> The principal change in Chapter 9, is the replacement of three separate sections in the 5th edition on parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas with a single Section 9.6 that provides a unified treatment of all the conic sections.</li> <li> <b>Infinite Series.</b> After the usual introduction to convergence of infinite sequences and series in Sections 10.2 and 10.3, a combined treatment of Taylor polynomials and Taylor series appears in Section 10.4. This makes it possible for the instructor to experiment with a briefer treatment of infinite series, but still offer exposure to the Taylor series that are so important for applications. The principal change in Chapter 10 is the addition of a new final section on power series methods and their use to introduce new transcendental functions, thereby concluding the middle third of the book with a return to differential equations.</li> <li> <b>Vectors and Matrices.</b> After covering vectors in its first four sections, Chapter 11 continues with three sections on solution of linear systems (through elementary Gaussian elimination), matrices (through calculation of inverse matrices), and eigenvalues and eigenvectors and th...</li></ul></p><h2>Martha Stewart&#39;s Slow Cooker: 110 Recipes for Flavorful, Foolproof Dishes (Including Desserts!), Plus Test-Kitchen Tips and Strategies: A Cookbook</h2><p><p><b>Cook it slow, cook it smart</b><br><br>Leave it to the experts at Martha Stewart to figure out the best ways to use this favorite appliance.

C. Sproul has committed his life to clearly communicating deep, practical truths from God's Word to students and laypeople. His lucid teaching style brings clarity to the most difficult--and often contentious--biblical and theological questions. Gathered here in one volume are three of his best-selling books--over $40 worth of reading at a great low price.</p><p>From Rudolf Otto's" mysterium tremendum" to Martin Luther's "insanity"and Jonathan Edwards's fiery sermons, Sproul's classic "The Holiness of God"illuminates history and Scripture to help readers understand--and live with--the tension that exists between God's terrifying holiness and his inexplicable grace.</p><p>In "Chosen by God," Sproul tackles the divisive subject of predestination, and discusses God's sovereignty and the problem of evil, human freedom, and the task of evangelism. He explains that there is a mystery in God's ways but not contradiction; and paints a picture of a loving--not spiteful or whimsical--God who provides redemption for radically corrupt people."Pleasing God" explores the topic of sanctification--how we satisfy God by pursuing righteousness. Sproul examines the constant battle Christians wage against sin--pride, slothfulness, dishonesty. He reveals how many Christians have tragically abandoned the struggle, but that God delights in those who press on.</p><p>Although Sproul brings a Reformed background and approach to topics, his work is not just for Calvinists but for all Christians who want to understand and build on the foundations of their faith.</p></p><p><p>R.

Indeed, his biography of Einstein was the winner of the 1983 American Book Award and was selected by <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> as one of the Best Books of the Year. As a distinguished theoretical physicist who was a friend and colleague of Einstein and Bohr, Pais is able to blend a sophisticated understanding of physics with a first-hand knowledge of the private individual, offering us insights into both. It is this unique double perspective that makes his work so valuable.<br> Now, in <em>The Genius of Science</em>, Pais offers us insightful portraits of twelve of our century's most distinguished physicists, all of whom he has known personally. We meet, among others, the famously taciturn Paul Dirac; Max Born, who coined the term 'quantum mechanics'; Wolfgang Pauli, famed for his exclusion principle and known as the conscience of twentieth-century physics; Mitchell Feigenbaum, inventor of chaos theory; and John von Neumann, one of the most influential mathematicians of the century. Other scientists profiled include Res Jost, Isidor Rabi, Viktor Weisskopf, and Eugene Wigner. In addition, because their work is so relevant to the others discussed, Pais has included chapters on Einstein and Bohr, in each case giving the essence of the man's character and scientific achievement.<br> Throughout the volume, Pais illuminates the personalities and achievements of these stellar scientists. The result is virtually a who's who of 20th-century physics--a superb collection of portraits that sheds light on the physicists, their work, and their lasting influence on science.</p><p>Physics might seem part of an alien culture to most people, but it has touched all our lives, and its byproducts, in the form of nuclear fission, are going to remain with us for many generations to come. It could be argued that the 20th century was the century of theoretical physics. <i>The Genius of Science</i> is, as its subtitle claims, a portrait gallery of 16 of the most interesting and eminent of the international physicists who helped change our view of the world--from Niels Bohr to Eugene Wigner. But the list of characters is much, much larger and interweaves most of the international network of physicists and other prominent scientists of the last century. Author Abraham Pais, an eminent American theoretical physicist and professor at Rockefeller University, has written acclaimed biographies of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, two of the greatest scientists of the 20th century. Pais was acquainted with many of the people he writes about, and he often appears in the book as a shadowy figure in the background. Anyone can dip into <i>The Genius of Science</i> anywhere in its pages and be immediately grabbed by both the extraordinary and the ordinary aspects of the lives of these scientists. The author provides plenty of anecdotes, from those about Bohr's pipe-smoking to Robert Oppenheimer's reaction to the first successful atomic bomb test: "... some lines of the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> went through his mind: I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."<p> Pais wants to bring life back to these people, but not in any salacious way; he admits to having "never been interested in entering others' bedrooms." If you want psycho-biography or scandal, you will not find it here. But the general reader will get a sense of the trials, tribulations, and excitement of the scientific life.

Cross-national statistical research on political democracy supports this claim. By contrast, comparative historical studies carried out within a political economy approach argue that economic development was and is compatible with multiple political forms.<br><br>The authors offer a fresh and persuasive resolution to the controversy arising out of these contrasting traditions. Focusing on advanced industrial countries, Latin America, and the Caribbean, they find that the rise and persistence of democracy cannot be explained either by an overall structural correspondence between capitalism and democracy or by the role of the bourgeoisie as the agent of democratic reform. Rather, capitalist development is associated with democracy because it transforms the class structure, enlarging the working and middle classes, facilitating their self-organization, and thus making it more difficult for elites to exclude them. Simultaneously, development weakens the landed upper class, democracy's most consistent opponent.<br><br>The relationship of capitalist development to democracy, however, is not mechanical. As the authors show, it depends on a complex interplay of three clusters of power: the balance of power among social classes, power relations between the state and society, and transnational structures of economic and political power. Looking to the future, the book concludes with some reflections on current prospects for the development of stable democracy in Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p><p><p><b>John D.

Marieb, taking the student's perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience, along with stories from the field-including those of former students, now in health careers-that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her texts and laboratory manuals are known. In her ongoing commitment to students and her realization of the challenges they face, Dr. Marieb has given generously to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women returning to college after a hiatus or who are attending college for the first time and would otherwise be unable to continue with their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. MariebScience Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and generously contributed to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory that bears her name. In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College. In May 2000, the science building at Holyoke Community College was named in her honor. Additionally, while actively engaged as an author, Dr. Marieb serves as a consultant for the Benjamin Cummings "InterActive Physiology�" CD-ROM series, and is an active member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS). "Anatomy &amp; Physiology," Second Edition is the latest expression of her commitment to student needs in their pursuit of the study of A&amp;P.</p><h2>The Complete Cosmicomics</h2><p><p><b>The definitive edition of Calvino&#x2019;s cosmicomics, bringing together all of these enchanting stories&#x2014;including some never before translated&#x2014;in one volume for the first time</b></p><p>In Italo Calvino&#x2019;s cosmicomics, primordial beings cavort on the nearby surface of the moon, play marbles with atoms, and bear ecstatic witness to Earth&#x2019;s first dawn.

Written by one of the most renowned scholars in the field, this vivid and engaging introductory text relates the story of the search for a cognitive scientific understanding of mind. This search is presented as a no-holds-barred journey from early work in artificial intelligence, through connectionist (artificial neural network) counter-visions, and on to neuroscience, artificial life, dynamics, and robotics. The journey ends with some wide-ranging and provocative speculation about the complex coadaptive dance between mind, culture, and technology. <br> Each chapter opens with a brief sketch of a major research tradition or perspective, followed by short yet substantial critical discussions dealing with key topics and problems. Ranging across both standard philosophical territory and the landscape of cutting-edge cognitive science, Clark highlights challenging issues in an effort to engage readers in active debate. Topics covered include mental causation; machine intelligence; the nature and status of folk psychology; the hardware/software distinction; emergence; relations between life and mind; the nature of perception, cognition, and action; and the continuity (or otherwise) of high-level human intelligence with other forms of adaptive response. Numerous illustrations, text boxes, and extensive suggestions for further reading enhance the text's utility. Helpful appendices provide background information on dualism, behaviorism, identity theory, consciousness, and more. An exceptional text for introductory and more advanced courses in cognitive science and the philosophy of mind, <em>Mindware</em> is also essential reading for anyone interested in these fascinating and ever-changing fields.</p><p>Andy Clark is at University of Sussex, England."A lively whirlwind tour of emerging issues in cognitive science.

Wodehouse to Ruth Rendell. He is an author of both non-fiction and fiction.It&#39;s difficult to perform the straight narrative of a biography entertainingly, but Paul Michael does a good job by changing his accents on the few occasions when non-Herriot characters are quoted. His overall intonation is properly regional, and anyone who enjoyed All Creatures Great and Small would probably enjoy this audiobook. The book focuses on distinguishing between the lives of the pseudonymous James Herriot and his creator, veterinarian Alf Wight. There were many similarities and some differences, as when Wight made embellishments to his own life for interviewers. It&#39;s especially interesting to see how the fictional characters stack up against their real-life counterparts. D.W.

He is the visionary behind the exhibition, and is a third-generation Mexican American who holds the world's largest private collection of Chicano art. Marin is also an active participant in the Hispanic Scholarship Fund.<br>Marin is an art collector and community activist as well as a director and actor (one-half of the Cheech and Chong duo and costar of <i>Nash Bridges</i>) and a pioneer in recognizing the vibrancy and significance of Chicano art. The Chicano school began evolving 30 years ago as artists sought to combine traditional Mexican imagery, themes, and styles with American pop, and it is now the source for some of America's most evocative, animated, brilliantly hued, inventive, and gripping contemporary painting. Marin's extraordinary collection forms the foundation for this exciting and invaluable showcase for the spiritually powerful and aesthetically diverse work of 30 seminal artists, including John Valadez, Gronk, Diane Gamboa, Patssi Valdez, Adan Hernandez, and Carlos Almaraz. Gorgeous color plates are accompanied by brief artist bios, Marin's impassioned introduction, and illuminating essays by art critic Max Benavidez, who traces the political, social, and artistic roots of the Chicano sensibility; curator Tere Romo, who concentrates on Chicana artists; and art historian Constance Cortez, who discusses the concept of Aztlan, "a geographic and a symbolic locale" that inspires many Chicano painters. Sensuous, cosmic, or satirical, Chicano paintings reflect our symbiotic, bicultural world in all its conflicts and soulfulness, sorrows and beauty. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The Doctor Versus the P�quois</p><p>He was frowning. Perhaps, like a schoolboy, he was poking out the tip of his tongue? Lips set, a sulky expression on his face, he was snatching glimpses at G�ne, trying to imitate his movements as closely as possible.</p><p>But it was no good: something was wrong, because the result wasn&#x2019;t the same. He was honest enough to recognize this, and obstinate enough to contain his impatience. His hand was trailing outside the boat, like G�ne&#x2019;s, no more or less,quite relaxed; he had immediately understood that it was essential to relax. Only his index finger was slightly raised, supporting the hempen fishing line that the locals called a <i>boulantin</i>.</p><p>The quality of the line wasn&#x2019;t in question. His and G�ne&#x2019;s were identical. Just now, G�ne, who always guessed what he was thinking without ever looking at him, had suggested:</p><p>&#x2018;Come over here. Take my place, hold my line. Could be you&#x2019;ll have more luck then.&#x2019;</p><p>The sea, calm as a millpond, without a ripple, was breathing slowly but deeply. And this imperceptible movement troubled the doctor more than the turbulent pounding of waves might have. At every shift of the liquid surface, he could feel the leadweight on his line lifting from the bottom. So he leaned over the side. He could see about ten metres down, perhaps more, a scene to which he found it hard to accustom himself, rocks separating deep purple clefts, a plateau covered with seaweed, and mostof all the fish, quite big fish, silver or rusty-red, coming and going peaceably, in silence, hesitating sometimes for an instant in front of his bait. In spite of his efforts, his hand trembled, a slight moisture broke out on his upper lip, he was ready to give a tug on his line. Why hadthat fish turned away?</p><p>He raised his head and sighed. He found it impossible to stay long peering deep into the water. His heart was palpitating. He had a pain at the back of his eyes and a headache. It was becoming a nightmare. Every time he looked at the M�des rock,he had the sensation that the little boat, with its two pointed ends, was getting nearer to it. They didn&#x2019;t even have an anchor. G�ne had simply dropped a large stone into the water on the end of a rope. Was he watching out for the rock? You could see quite clearly how the sea rose andfell, uncovering a large strip of viscous moss and shellfish. Without any breakers, the water was nevertheless covered with white foam, and some of the enormous bubbles washed up against the hull of the boat.</p><p>G�ne sat on one of the thwarts, an old cap on his head, as motionless as a statue of Buddha, his gaze apparently ranging with indifference far into the dazzling horizon.</p><p>Of this, the doctor could only see a blaze that irritated his retina, whereas G�ne, who could see everything, announced expressionlessly:</p><p>&#x2018;Here comes the <i>Cormoran</i>, she&#x2019;s back from La Tour-Fondue&nbsp;...&nbsp;There&#x2019;s Joseph setting his nets by the lighthouse.&#x2019;</p><p>As he spoke, he was pulling in his line, unhurriedly, as if checking that the hooks were still baited, but there was always a fish on the end.</p><p>&#x2018;A <i>p�quois.</i>&#x2019;</p><p>And he slipped it into a container full of fresh algae, picked up a hermit crab (they called them <i>piades</i> here), smashed its shell and threaded it on to the hook.</p><p>Rattled, the doctor hauled in his own line. It was jerking, alive. Every time it did this, he sensed he had a big catch, that a miracle was happening and that he was going to amaze the fisherman. And every time, it was one of those nasty fishcovered with spines, not even a scorpion-fish, but what G�ne called a <i>diable</i>, which had to be taken off the hook &#x2013; first wrapping one&#x2019;s hand in a cloth &#x2013; and thrown back into the water.</p><p>Why could he only catch these <i>diables</i>, or at best tiny <i>s�rans</i>? They were fishing in the same place, no more than a metre apart. You could see quite clearly down in the water the pink tips of the hermit-crab shells moving acrossthe sea floor; twice their lines had become entangled. You could see the fish too. The doctor was certain he was making the same movements as G�ne. He wasn&#x2019;t a novice. Back in Saint-Hilaire, he was the only angler capable of light fly-fishing on the S�vre, a more delicate skill thansea-fishing.</p><p>He had taken a sudden dislike to that great rock rising up out of the sea so close to them, which continued, heaven knew why, to frighten him. He was getting equally irritated with the sea itself, the perfectly calm blue sea, on which he had beenso happy to sail out on this little white boat with its blue gunnels.</p><p>His wife had not dared to tease him when he had come back from the cooperative store wearing a straw hat in the shape of a pith helmet, such as he had seen worn by the locals: she had simply said, with herprovincial accent:</p><p>&#x2018;You bought a hat, then?&#x2019;</p><p>He had only to look up to see her, perhaps three hundred metres away; it was difficult, with the water in between, to gauge distances. In the curve of the bay lay one of the island&#x2019;s sandy beaches, Notre-Dame Beach, shaded by umbrellapines. That white patch on the sand was his wife, sitting quite still, occupied in sewing or knitting. The black patch alongside her was Mariette, their young housemaid, whom they had brought on holiday with them from Saint-Hilaire. The tiny figure doing somersaults on the sand or climbingon to the women&#x2019;s laps was their son Michel, and the little girl, who was called back every time the water reached her knees, their daughter.</p><p>He could see them, and from where they were, they could see him, sitting at one end of G�ne&#x2019;s small boat. It was very hot. Skin exposed to the sun would bake, and by next morning would have turned brick-red. He had experienced this the daybefore. He had gone out for a walk with his shirtsleeves rolled up. Now, as far as the elbows, his arms looked like raw meat, while higher up the skin seemed pale and unhealthy.</p><p>He felt light-headed. He was regretting having hired G�ne for an afternoon&#x2019;s fishing. He would have liked to turn for home, but dared not suggest it.</p><p>It was looking down into the depths especially that did it. That clear landscape, so strange and inhuman that he felt he was discovering another planet. The smells too, the salt water, his fingers, which hadbeen handling fish and shellfish, the fragrance from the sun-baked Mediterranean shrubs, carried out to them on the breeze.</p><p>He still clung to the childish hope of hooking a good catch and surprising G�ne; he frowned even harder, and leaned out over the water until he was dizzy.</p><p>They had been in Porquerolles only four days, and already he was tired of it. Utterly worn out. The sun was exhausting. Everything required an effort, an effort to adapt, an effort to understand. The island was indeed beautiful, as his friendGardanne, the painter of the river S�vre near Nantes, had assured him.

A gripping tale of murder, intrigue, madness, and mistaken identity, Collins&#x2019;s psychological thriller has never been out of print in the 140 years since its publication. Anne Perry writes in her Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic (set from the &#x201c;New Edition&#x201d; of 1861), &#x201c;[<b>The Woman in White</b>] has lasted, to our great pleasure, because it is superb storytelling about people who engage our minds and our imaginations.&#x201d;</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "&#x201c;Collins was a master craftsman, whom many modern mystery-mongers might imitate to their profit.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Dorothy L.

The Caliph Vathek is dissolute and debauched, and hungry for knowledge. When the mysterious Giaour offers him boundless treasure and unrivalled power he is willing to sacrifice his god, the lives of innocent children, and his own soul to satisfy his obsession. Vathek's extraordinary journey to the subterranean palace of Eblis, and the terrifying fate that there awaits him, is a captivating tale of magic and oriental fantasy, sudden violence and corrupted love, whose mix of moral fable, grotesque comedy, and evocative beauty defies classification. <br><br>This new edition reprints Beckford's authorized English text of 1816 with its elaborate and entertaining notes. In his new Introduction, Thomas Keymer pays special attention to the novel's literary qualities, its hybrid nature and its connections with oriental fiction and the Gothic as well as to its origins and Beckford's scandalous public persona. Completely reset, the second edition includes new, fuller notes, an up-to-date bibliography, and a new chronology of the author. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

It approaches textiles from a product analysis approach, using professional terminology, and provides examples to illustrate key concepts.<b> </b> Flow charts on identifying fabric structure and naming fancy woven fabrics; other fabrication methods; and knits have been added. Also included are tables summarizing components such as fibers, yarns, fabric structure, and finishes. An expanded glossary makes it easier for readers to find pertinent information. <b> </b> For designers, technical designers, apparel engineers, and others in the fashion/apparel business.</p><p>Chapters are organized to follow the order in which textiles are addressed in the industry, beginning with coverage of fibers, and following with sections on yarns, fabric construction, and fabric finishes. Material includes traditional background information, an overview of the historical development of the textile industry, discussion of production processes, and major uses for each fiber, plus a review of new developments in the field. Equal attention is paid to both apparel and furnishings textiles, with the focus on helping students develop an understanding of how performance and characteristics are engineered to provide serviceable textile products.With an emphasis on serviceability, this popular book continues its focus on three major end uses of textiles: apparel, furnishing and industrial products. Readers will learn the basic knowledge of textiles they&#39;ll need to make informed decisions regarding textile material and products. It includes comprehensive coverage of new fibers and finishes, legislation, production issues, and cost is presented in a clear, straight-forward manner, making this one of the best textile books available.</p><h2>The Complete Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</h2><p>The comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan are a performing arts phenomenon. Wildly popular when first produced, they are if anything even more popular today. The Savoy Operas are available on records and compact discs, on audio and video tapes, on television, film, and radio, as well as through the more traditional medium of stage performances by both amateur and professional companies. Indeed, the works of Gilbert and Sullivan are produced more frequently than the plays of Rodgers and Hammerstein or any other musical partnership. <br> <em>The Complete Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</em> provides the complete text of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan operas still performed today, from <em>Trial by Jury</em> and <em>The Sorcerer</em> to <em>Utopia Unlimited</em> and <em>The Grand Duke</em>, and including all their greatest triumphs--<em>H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of</em> <em>Penzance,</em> and <em>The Mikado</em>. No other book provides such extensive commentary on the texts of the Savoy Operas. Each work is thoroughly annotated, with the text, including stage directions, given on the right-hand page, and the notes on the left (keyed by line numbers). The annotations provide a wealth of information--everything from the identity of real-life people mentioned in the opera, to clear explanations of obscure words and phrases (such as legal terms) and other literary references, to comments from first-night critics, and much more. In addition, Bradley has written a marvelously informative introduction to the book as well as superb introductions to each piece, describing the genesis of the work, its performance history, and other fascinating tidbits (for instance, Sullivan wrote the music for <em>H.M.S. Pinafore</em> while wracked with pain from a kidney stone, and he wrote the score of <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em> while living at 45 East 20th Street, in New York City).<br> A goldmine of information on the most popular light operas in the repertoire, <em>The Complete Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</em> will delight the hearts of Savoyards everywhere.</p><p>Gilbert and Sullivan, librettist and composer, were classically Victorian gentlemen whose comic operas for the Savoy Theater under impresario Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte have endured down to the present day despite the disappearance of the British imperial world which they lampooned. Theirs was a happy combination of Sullivan&#39;s cheerily catchy tunes and Gilbert&#39;s witty lyrics which captured the comedy of universal human nature. Ian Bradley, annotator of an earlier Gilbert and Sullivan collection, completes and updates the record with the inclusion here of the last collaborations of the two, and new introductions to the operettas that reflect modern interpretations.<br><strong>Ian Bradley</strong> is one of the world's leading authorities on Gilbert and Sullivan, the editor of a previous annotated edition of the Savoy Operas, and a consultant to the D'Oyly Carte Company on historical matters.<br></p><h2>Seam (Crab Orchard Series in Poetry)</h2><p><p>The poems in this captivating collection weave beauty with violence, the personal with the historic as they recount the harrowing experiences of the two hundred thousand female victims of rape and torture at the hands of the Pakistani army during the 1971 Liberation War. As the child of Bangladeshi immigrants, the poet in turn explores her own losses, as well as the complexities of bearing witness to the atrocities these war heroines endured.</p><p>Throughout the volume, the narrator endeavors to bridge generational and cultural gaps even as the victims recount the horror of grief and personal loss.

With patience and immaculate lyric precision, and with sublime attention to language and the courage to interrogate her privilege and curiosity, Faizullah twines a seam where the wounds are re-membered, fingers quivering, spooling, and unspooling what we know of healing. This is a powerful debut, a reminder that some things should perhaps never be forgiven, a poignant record set against forgetfulness." &nbsp; --Khaled Mattawa<br><br>"How thin the seam between this fierce book and all the poet's countrypeople who haven't lived to read it.

Pavel Machotka has photographed the sites of Cezanne's landscape paintings - whenever possible from the same spot and at the same time of day that Cezanne painted the scenes. Juxtaposing these color photographs with reproductions of the paintings, he offers a dazzling range of evidence to demonstrate how the great painter transformed nature into works of art.<br>Machotka, himself an artist, moves from painting to painting, examining textures and surfaces, pictorial rhythms, and inflections of tone. As he analyzes Cezanne's treatment of individual sites, their transposition into forms and colors, and the artist's responsiveness to the demands of each unique composition, we begin to see Cezanne as he saw himself: not as an early Cubist, but as a painter who explored every aspect of his motif for its rich compositional potential and presented a parallel and faithful conception of it. Using color to define form, while retaining hues that are anchored in reality, Cezanne achieved sensuous reconstructions, rather than intellectual depictions like those of the Cubists.<br>While there are other books on Cezanne's landscapes, none is as closely informed by painterly knowledge and perception or as complete in its grasp of Cezanne's period and geography as this one. A visual delight, it is also an illuminating and original interaction with the artist's work.</p><p>Pavel Machotka is Professor of Psychology and Art at the University of California, Santa Cruz.For most of this century, artists and scholars have been amazed by the richness of Cezanne's work. Painter and photographer Machotka (psychology and art, Univ. of California, Santa Cruz) builds upon past scholarship to illuminate the individual landscape sites and their relationship to Cezanne's paintings through the use of early black-and-white photographs and new color photos that he took himself. He wants to see how Cezanne interpreted what he saw and explores the artist's interest in observing nature and creating a painting using the structure of the flat surface to draw a parallel to nature. Like Cezanne, Machotka observes and uses nature, and he stresses Cezanne's intent as an artist rather than analyzing the elements of his paintings. The 144 illustrations include photographs, color reproductions of the paintings, and full-page details showing brushstrokes, color, and texture. This book about a painter written by a painter will appeal to painters as well as students and scholars of modern art.?Ellen Bates, New York<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The High Cost of Free Parking</h2><p>Off-street parking requirements are devastating American cities. So says the author&nbsp;in this no-holds-barred treatise on the way parking should be. Free parking,&nbsp;the author&nbsp;argues, has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion, but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way.&nbsp;The author&nbsp;proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking, namely, charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking.</p><p><b>Donald C.

It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay when, if I apply myself, maybe I can get it for free?" The High Cost of Free Parking, Donald Shoup's 733-page tour de force, has the answer. With the exception of a Monopoly board, there is no such thing as free parking. In fact, free parking turns out to be the biggest problem you never thought about. "We all want to park free," Shoup writes. "But we also want to reduce traffic congestion, energy consumption and air pollution. We want affordable housing, efficient transportation, green space, good urban design, great cities and a healthy economy. Unfortunately, ample free parking conflicts with all these other goals."<br><br>But is this beach reading? Yes. Shoup is witty and profound. The Yoda of urban planning, he compares the current national parking situation to the overfishing of communal waters, an outbreak of cicadas, the Ptolemaic view of the universe, and all-you-can-eat buffets. The book inspired me to begin building an SUV-size apartment on wheels and park it in the Manhattan neighborhood of my choice. Call it "Alternate Side of Street Living."

Colors begins with the three primary colors, using the sheets to show first the outside, then the inside of a colored pencil, magic marker, and paintbrush. Then the strength of the format becomes apparent, as the acetate sheets facilitate secondary colors. Pink ice cream becomes orange sherbet; a blue frog takes on its proper green shade, etc. The changes are sophisticated and will require further explanation; moreover, the images on the sheets do not always line up with those on the pages. Weather works more like a book by John Goodall, with the plastic sheets advancing the story much as his half-pages do. A cold autumn day is followed by snow falling on the acetate page; it in turn transforms a fall landscape into a snowy one, complete with snowman. The story is rather slight, but it does convey weather's propensity for quick changes, and children will enjoy the gimmick. Both books will require adults to explain the principles to younger children, but those in the primary grades will acquire scientific information painlessly. --Karen K.

I've never really wanted to put it away and be done with it forever -- the second I first 'finished' it, I wanted to dig back in and change everything around. So I'm looking forward to getting back into the text, and straightening and focusing and deleting. Most of all, I'm thrilled that Vintage will be letting me include all the cool chase scenes, previously censored." -- Dave Eggers<br><br>The literary sensation of the year, a book that redefines both family and narrative for the twenty-first century. <b>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius </b>is the moving memoir of a college senior who, in the space of five weeks, loses both of his parents to cancer and inherits his seven-year-old brother. Here is an exhilarating debut that manages to be simultaneously hilarious and wildly inventive as well as a deeply heartfelt story of the love that holds a family together.<br><br><b>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</b> is an instant classic that will be read in paperback for decades to come.<br><br>PAPERBACK EDITION -- 15% MORE STAGGERING - Eggers has written 15,000 additional words for the Vintage Canada edition, including an entirely new appendix.</p><p>Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story</i>? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even <i>get</i> to the true story, including a preface, a list of "Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book," and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled "Here is a drawing of a stapler:").<p> But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a "single mother" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's <i>Hiroshima</i>.)</p><p> The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny <i>Might Magazine</i>, and he spends a fair amount of time here on <i>Might</i>, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's <i>Real World</i>. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into <i>A.H.W.O.S.G.</i> already. "The book thereafter is kind of uneven," he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and <i>interesting</i>. </p><p> All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal <i>McSweeney's</i> (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt <i>for</i> him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"For 40 years readers have been waiting around on J. D. Salinger to send down a new manuscript from high atop his reclusive Vermont mountain. Well, the vigil is over and we can forget about hearing from Salinger.

What is it really about? Why does it matter? What makes theorizing about knowledge "philosophical?" Why do some philosophers argue that epistemology--perhaps even philosophy itself--is dead? <br> In this succinct, exciting, and original introduction to epistemology, Michael Williams explains and criticizes philosophical theories of the nature, limits, methods, possibility, and value of knowing. A coherent and progressive text, <em>Problems of Knowledge</em> covers both traditional and contemporary approaches to the subject, including foundationalism, the coherence theory, and "naturalistic" theories. As an alternative to these perspectives, Williams defends his own distinctive contextualist approach. <em>Problems of Knowledge</em> provides clear and engaging explanations of the theory of knowledge and why it matters, offering an excellent foundation for students in introductory epistemology courses.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Williams</strong> is the Charles and Emma Morrison Professor of Humanities, and Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University. He has previously held positions at Yale and the University of Maryland.<br>A masterly introduction to epistemology and an original contribution, this book succeeds on both levels. Those who know Michael Williams's earlier work will not be surprised by the rich texture of his writing and by how well it conveys the history and geography of the land of epistemology,<br>while staking out a position of his own within it. Without piling on references, never woodenly didactic, Williams's manuscript still shows his mastery of the subject, in both its historical length and its contemporary breadth.

Imbued with a spectral grace, as if told through an enchanted looking glass, the novel follows the adolescent Arturo through his days on the isolated Neapolitan island of Procida, where&#x2015;his mother long deceased, his father often absent, and a dog as his sole companion&#x2015;he roams the countryside and the beaches or reads in his family&#x2019;s lonely, dilapidated mansion. This quiet, meandering existence is upended when his father brings home a beautiful sixteen-year-old bride, Nunziatella.</p><p>A novel of longing and thwarted desires, filled with Morante&#x2019;s &#x201c;brutal directness and familial torment&#x201d; (James Wood), <em>Arturo&#x2019;s Island</em> reemerges in this splendid translation to take its rightful place in the world literary canon.</p></p><p><p><strong>Elsa Morante</strong>&nbsp;(1912&#x2013; 1985) was a prize-winning Italian novelist and poet. Born in Rome, Morante was married to Albert Moravia.</p><p><strong>Ann Goldstein</strong>, the editor of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> and the award-winning translator of Elena Ferrante&#x2019;s novels, is a former editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s themes &#x2015; incest, misogyny, narcissism, homosexuality &#x2015; slide across the pages like lava. Morante delivers epic emotions. Her people don&#x2019;t talk so much as they exclaim 'with a contemptuous sneer' or 'a loud, haughty cry of derision.' They tremble with violent disgusts and savage attitudes. They strike poses of fear, loathing and, in the words of one character, 'aggressive, insolent vehemence.' They rattle the cutlery and they rattle each other. <em>Arturo&#x2019;s Island</em> kept calling out to me, however. It had set its brutal hooks.... [Morante&#x2019;s writing] has the power of malediction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dwight Garner, <i>New York Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I am pleased that <em>Arturo&#x2019;s Island</em> is having a second life, as, no doubt, the novel will garner its neglected author the new readers she deserves.

It's a magnificent novel, breathtaking in its psychological acuity. Arturo&#x2019;s maturation&#x2015;and accompanying disappointments, even betrayals&#x2015;is deeply painful. ...But there are moments, too, of striking beauty.... The book is brimful with insight. By turns devastating and otherworldly, Morante's novel is a classic, and Goldstein's new translation should return to it the attention it deserves.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Kirkus Reviews</i> [starred review]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this&nbsp;translation&nbsp;of&nbsp;Morante's arresting, febrile tale of abjection and adoration, originally&nbsp;published&nbsp;in 1957, Goldstein captures the blustery voice of an adolescent boy on Procida....

With a potent combination of lyrical compassion and resonant rage, he portrays a fourteen-year-old boy questioning the terms of his identity. John Grimes is the stepson of a fire-breathing and abusive Pentecostal preacher in Harlem during the Depression. The action of this short novel spans a single day in John&#x2019;s life, and yet manages to encompass on an epic scale his family&#x2019;s troubled past and his own inchoate longings for the future, set against a shining vision of a city where he both does and does not belong. Baldwin&#x2019;s story illuminates the racism his characters face as well as the double-edged role religion plays in their lives, both oppressive and inspirational. In prose that mingles gritty vernacular cadences with exalted biblical rhythms, Baldwin&#x2019;s rendering of his young protagonist&#x2019;s struggle to invent himself pioneered new possibilities in American language and literature.&nbsp;<br><br>Introduction by Edwidge Danticat</p><p>First published in 1953 when James Baldwin was nearly 30, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> is a young man's novel, as tightly coiled as a new spring, yet tempered by a maturing man's confidence and empathy. It's not a long book, and its action spans but a single day--yet the author packs in enough emotion, detail, and intimate revelation to make his story feel like a mid-20th-century epic. Using as a frame the spiritual and moral awakening of 14-year-old John Grimes during a Saturday night service in a Harlem storefront church, Baldwin lays bare the secrets of a tormented black family during the depression. John's parents, praying beside him, both wrestle with the ghosts of their sinful pasts--Gabriel, a preacher of towering hypocrisy, fathered an illegitimate child during his first marriage down South and refused to recognize his doomed bastard son; Elizabeth fell in love with a charming, free-spirited young man, followed him to New York, became pregnant with his son, and lost him before she could reveal her condition. <p> Baldwin lays down the terrible symmetries of these two blighted lives as the ironic context for John's dark night of the soul. When day dawns, John believes himself saved, but his creator makes it clear that this salvation arises as much from blindness as revelation: "He was filled with a joy, a joy unspeakable, whose roots, though he would not trace them on this new day of his life, were nourished by the wellspring of a despair not yet discovered." </p><p> Though it was hailed at publication for its groundbreaking use of black idiom, what is most striking about <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> today is its structure and its scope. In peeling back the layers of these damaged lives, Baldwin dramatizes the story of the great black migration from rural South to urban North. "Behind them was the darkness," Baldwin writes of Gabriel and Elizabeth's lost generation, "nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire--a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!" This is Baldwin's music--a music in which rhapsody is rooted anguish--and there is none finer in American literature. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>James Baldwin's stunning first novel is now an American classic. With startling realism that brings Harlem and the black experience vividly to life, this is a work that touches the heart with emotion while it stimulates the mind with its narrative style, symbolism, and excoriating vision of racism in America. Moving through time from the rural South to the northern ghetto, starkly contrasting the attitudes of two generations of an embattles family, <i>Go Tell It On The Mountain</i> is an unsurpassed portrayal of human beings caught up in a dramatic struggle and of a society confronting inevitable change. <p>"The most important novel written about the American Negro," says <i>Commentary</i>. "It is written with poetic intensity and great narrative skill," writes <i>Harper's</i>. <i>Saturday Review</i> praises it as "masterful," and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> declares that this important American novel is "brutal, objective and compassionate."</p></p><h2>Feminism and Science (Oxford Readings in Feminism)</h2><p>(Series copy)<br> The new <em>Oxford Readings in Feminism</em> series maps the dramatic influence of feminist theory on every branch of academic knowledge. Offering feminist perspectives on disciplines from history to science, each book assembles the most important articles written on its field in the last ten to fifteen years. Old stereotypes are challenged and traditional attitudes upset in these lively-- and sometimes controversial--volumes, all of which are edited by feminists prominent in their particular field. Comprehensive, accessible, and intellectually daring, the <em>Oxford Readings in Feminism</em> series is vital reading for anyone interested in the effects of feminist ideas within the academy. <br> <br> Can science be gender-neutral? In recent years, feminist critics have raised troubling questions about the practice and goals of traditional science, demonstrating the existence of a pervasive bias in the ways in which scientists conduct and discuss their work. This exciting volume gathers seventeen essays--by sociologists, scientists, historians, and philosophers--of seminal significance in the emerging field of feminist science studies. Analyzing topics from the stereotype of the "Man of Reason" to the "romantic" language of reproductive biology, these fascinating essays challenge readers to take a fresh look at the limitations--and possibilities--of scientific knowledge.<br></p><p>Over the past fifteen years, a new dimension to the analysis of science has emerged. Feminist theory, combined with the insights of recent developments in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, has raised a number of new and important questions about the content, practice, and traditional goals of science. Feminists have pointed to a bias in the choice and definition of problems with which scientist have concerned themselves, and in the actual design and interpretation of experiments, and have argued that modern science evolved out of a conceptual structuring of the world that incorporated particular and historically specific ideologies of gender. The seventeen articles in this outstanding volume reflect the diversity and strengths of feminist contributions to current thinking about science.<br>RIAbout the Editors:<br> <strong>Evelyn Fox Keller</strong> is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A foreword by Mary Kay&#x2019;s grandson, also a company executive, introduces her timeless guide to entrepreneurial success.</p><p><p>Praise for The Mary Kay Way</p> <p>"One of the most inspiring entrepreneurial leaders, Mary Kay always understood the importance of people and the value they can bring to an organization."<br> &#x2014;J.W. Marriott, Jr., Chairman and CEO, Marriott International, Inc.</p> <p>"Mary Kay knew that when you put people first and then surround them with processes and disciplines that recognize their efforts, performance will soar."<br> &#x2014;David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, Yum! Brands, Inc. (KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Long John Silver's, A&amp;W)</p> <p>Mary Kay Ash built a global independent sales force that today numbers 1.8 million women, and is respected by business and academic leaders. How? The secret is in this book.</p> <p>For forty-five years, the principles in The Mary Kay Way have helped the company succeed through changing economic times and explosive global growth. It has been said that no company wholeheartedly embodies the values and reflects the beliefs of its founder more than Mary Kay Inc. Now you can put the same inspiring principles to work for you.</p> <p>Recognized today as America's greatest woman entrepreneur, Mary Kay Ash stepped out in 1963 in a man's world to blaze a new path for women. She grew her business based not on the rules of competition, but on The Golden Rule. By "praising people to success" and "sandwiching every bit of criticism between two heavy layers of praise," this energetic Texas titan opened new opportunities for women around the world and built a multibillion-dollar corporation.</p> <p>Mary Kay's unconventional business philosophy was first published in 1984. Now revised and updated for the first time, with examples from her company's top independent salespeople, The Mary Kay Way is perhaps her most important legacy.</p><p>"Leaders teach. They motivate. They care. Leaders make sure that the way to success is always broad enough and straight enough for others to follow."<br> &#x2014;Mary Kay Ash</p> <p>Mary Kay helped open the door for countless women throughout the world to find success on their own terms and to be their own bosses. The Mary Kay Way is her inspiring "how-to manual." It explains her people-centered business philosophy and how to succeed by staying true to yourself, your values, and your customers.</p> <p>From The Mary Kay Way:</p> <p>"Every person is special! I sincerely believe this. Each of us wants to feel good about ourself, but to me, it is just as important to make others feel the same way. Whenever I meet someone, I try to imagine him or her wearing an invisible sign that says: make me feel important! I respond to this sign immediately, and it works wonders.</p> <p>Some people, however, are so caught up in themselves that they fail to realize that the other person wants to feel important too.</p> <p>Once I waited in a long reception line, and when I finally got to shake hands with the company's sales manager, he treated me as if I didn't exist. I'm sure he didn't remember the incident; in fact, he probably was never aware of how much he had hurt me. Yet, after all these years, I still remember&#x2014;so it obviously had a powerful impact on me. I learned an important lesson about people that day, which I have never forgotten: no matter how busy you are, you must take time to make the other person feel important!"</p></p><h2>The Couple Checkup</h2><p><p><strong>A book and online profile that identifies a couple's strengths to help them build a more vital relationship.</strong></p><p>Based on an unprecedented national survey of 50,000 marriages, <em>The Couple Checkup</em> presents the principles for creating a successful couple relationship.

The millennia-long debate is well documented in the literature in the history and philosophy of science and religion in Western civilization. <i>Science and Eastern Orthodoxy</i> is a departure from that vast body of work, providing the first general overview of the relationship between science and Christian Orthodoxy, the official church of the Oriental Roman Empire. </p><p>This pioneering study traces a rich history over an impressive span of time, from Saint Basil&#x2019;s <i>Hexameron</i> of the fourth century to the globalization of scientific debates in the twentieth century. Efthymios Nicolaidis argues that conflicts between science and Greek Orthodoxy&#x2015;when they existed&#x2015;were not science versus Christianity but rather ecclesiastical debates that traversed the whole of society. </p><p>Nicolaidis explains that during the Byzantine period, the Greek fathers of the church and their Byzantine followers wrestled passionately with how to reconcile their religious beliefs with the pagan science of their ancient ancestors. What, they repeatedly asked, should be the church&#x2019;s official attitude toward secular knowledge? From the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century to its dismantling in the nineteenth century, the patriarchate of Constantinople attempted to control the scientific education of its Christian subjects, an effort complicated by the introduction of European science in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. </p><p><i>Science and Eastern Orthodoxy</i> provides a wealth of new information concerning Orthodoxy and secular knowledge&#x2015;and the reactions of the Orthodox Church to modern sciences.</p></p><p><p><b>Efthymios Nicolaidis</b> is director of the Programme for the History, Philosophy, and Didactics of Science and Technology at the National Hellenic Research Foundation. He has written and edited a number of books on the history of science in Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire and coedited <i>L&#x2019;Europe des sciences: constitution d&#x2019;un espace scientifique.</i></p><p>"An excellent contribution to college library world history and religious studies shelves."</p> (James A. Cox <i>Midwest Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>"A thorough and exacting refutation of the idea that Orthodoxy rejects science outright."</p> (Katherine Warton <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"This book provides the English-speaking reader with invaluable insights and references which cover nearly a continuous two-thousand year period of interaction between faith and knowledge, science and technology. This book will certainly make a serious contribution to existing scholarship on the history of the relation between science and Christianity. It fills an essential, and inadmissible gap in research related to Byzantium, Eastern Europe, and Russia."</p> (Alexei V. Nesteruk <i>Perspectives in Science and Christian Faith</i>)<br><br><p>"Nicolaidis is well prepared to take on the difficult topic of science and Eastern Orthodoxy... The author lays an impressive foundation for future work... Highly recommended."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Nicolaidis offers not only a hitherto missing reference work, but also a fundamental contribution to the history of medieval science &#x2013; and a challenging reference for future debates."</p> (Constantin Canavas <i>Icon</i>)<br><br><p>"This is a very useful book to serve as supportive document for the teaching of the history of science and philosophy."</p> (Christiaan Sterken <i>Journal of Astronomical Data</i>)<br><br><p>"The book is in general of the highest scholarly standard, and it will be a major resource for students and historians of science and religion for decades to come."</p> (Christopher C. Knight <i>Metascience</i>)</p><h2>Socratic Logic 2E</h2><p>There are hundreds of logic tests in print, but none like this one.<p>(1) This is the only complete system of classical Aristotelian logic in print. The "old logic" is still the natural logic of the four language arts (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). Symbolic, or "mathematical," logic may be superior to classical "ordinary-language" Aristotelian logic for the sciences, but not for the humanities, and is more sophisticated theoretically but not more useful practically. (How often have you heard non-philosophers argue in symbolic logic?)</p><p>(2) This book is simple and user-friendly. It is highly interactive, with a plethora of exercises and a light, engaging style. Most beginners need a "back to basics" logic text rather than the latest overpriced one with state-of-the-art "bells and whistles" that they will never use outside class.</p><p>(3) It is practical. It is designed for do-it-yourselfers as well as classrooms. It emphasizes topics in proportion to probable student use: e.g., interpreting ordinary language, not only analyzing but also constructing effective arguments, smoking out hidden assumptions, making "argument maps," and using Socratic method in various circumstances. It is divided into eighty-eight mini-chapters for maximum mix-and-match flexibility.</p><p>(4) It is also philosophical. Its exercises expose students to many classical quotations, and additional chapters introduce philosophical issues in a Socratic manner and from a common-sense, realistic point of view. It prepares students for reading Great Books rather than Dick and Jane, and models Socrates as the beginner's ideal teacher and philosopher.</p></p><p>Peter Kreeft is the author of over 40 books, including A Refutation of Moral Relativism, Summa of the Summa, Christianity for Modern Pagans: A Commentary on Pascal&#39;s Pense�s, andC.S.

Despite the myth of the Euramerican that sees Oglala women as inferior to men, and the Lakota myth that seems them as superior, in reality, Powers argues, the roles of male and female emerge as complementary. In fact, she claims, Oglala women have been better able to adapt to the dominant white culture and provide much of the stability and continuity of modern tribal life. This rich ethnographic portrait considers the complete context of Oglala life&#x2014;religion, economics, medicine, politics, old age&#x2014;and is enhanced by numerous modern and historical photographs.<br> "It is a happy event when a fine scholarly work is rendered accessible to the general reader, especially so when none of the complexity of the subject matter is sacrificed. <i>Oglala Women</i> is a long overdue revisionary ethnography of Native American culture."&#x2014;Penny Skillman, <i>San Francisco Chronicle Review</i><br> <br> "Marla N.

Getting water in and out of the house without spilling it all over the place is essential to a family's quality of life.<br><br> The plumbing system brings luxuries easy to take for granted, such as hot showers, garbage disposers, and dishwashers -- all of which make daily life easier and better. <br><br> The down side is that eventually something will fail. Toilets leak, pipes burst, and faucets drip. Somebody has to fix them and that somebody might as well be you. <br><br> Plumbers make a good living because some people -- even experienced do-it-yourselfers -- are a little nervous about the idea of releasing streams of water into their kitchens while they're hooking up a new sink. In fact, if they take it step-by-step, installing a sink is well within the skill range of most homeowners. Of course, some plumbing jobs are best left to professionals, and it's important to understand that you should not attempt projects beyond your level of skill and experience.<br><br> What plumbers know is that success under the sink is a matter of logic, common sense, and following the instructions -- and that's what <i>Plumbing 1-2-3 (R)</i> is all about. On the following pages you'll find more than 90 step-by-step repair, replacement, and installation projects. Each project has been reviewed by the experts at The Home Depot (R) to ensure that it's accurate and easy to follow so you can get the job done right the first time. You'll also find plenty of plumbing tips and good advice that will save you time and money, and make every job easier. <br><br> There can be a lot of satisfaction in taking care of and improving the plumbing systems in your home.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>How To Read Lacan</h2><p><p>'The only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire' Jacques Lacan. </p><p>Is psychoanalysis dead or are we to read frequent attacks on its theoretical 'mistakes' and clinical 'frauds' as a proof of its vitality? Slavoj Zizek's passionate defence of Lacan reasserts the ethical urgency of psychoanalysis. Traditionally, psychoanalysis was expected to allow the patient to overcome the obstacles which prevented access to 'normal' sexual enjoyment. Today, however, we are bombarded from all sides by different versions of the injunction 'Enjoy!' Lacan reminds us that psychoanalysis is the only discourse in which you are allowed not to enjoy. Since for Lacan psychoanalysis itself is a procedure of reading, each chapter uses a passage from Lacan as a tool to interpret another text from philosophy, art or popular ideology, applying his ideas to Hegel and Hitchcock, Shakespeare and Dostoevsky.</p></p><p>Slavoj Zizek philosopher and psychoanalyst, heads the International Center of Humanities at Birkbeck College. His numerous books, translated into more than 30 languages, include <i>The Parallax View</i> and<i> Lacan: the Silent Partners.</i></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Appalachia</h2><p>Appalachia holds a curious place in the American psyche. There is a pervasive perception of the region as a hinterland inhabited by a backward and developmentally stunted people. Economically, culturally, and technologically suspended in an era gone by, this Appalachia is regarded as one of America&#39;s enduring social and economic problems.But there is another perception of Appalachia-home to the beautiful mountain system for which the region is named. It is a quaint retreat into the past, reflecting the integrity of a people with a pioneering spirit and lifestyle that pays homage to a simpler time.Until now, there has been no general reference work that captures the complexities of this enigmatic region. The only guide of its kind, the Encyclopedia of Appalachia is replete with information on every aspect of Appalachia&#39;s history, land, culture, and people.Containing more than 2,000 entries in 30 sections, the Encyclopedia is designed for quick reference and access to the information you need to know. Teachers, students, scholars, historians, and browsers with a passing interest in this beautiful and richly distinct region will quickly come to rely on the Encyclopedia of Appalachia as the authoritative resource on Appalachia&#39;s past and present.The Encyclopedia details subjects traditionally associated with Appalachia-folklore, handcrafts, mountain music, foods, and coal mining-but goes far beyond regional stereotypes to treat such wide-ranging topics as the aerospace industry, Native American foodways, ethnic diversity in the coalfields, education reform, linguistic variation, and the contested notion of what it means to be Appalachian, both inside and outside the region.Researched and developed by the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East Tennessee State University, this 1,840-page compendium includes all thirteen states that constitute the northern, central, and southern subregions of Appalachia-from New York to Mississippi. With thorough, detailed, yet accessible entries on everything from Adventists to zinc mining, the Encyclopedia of Appalachia is an indispensable, one-stop guide to all things Appalachian.</p><p>Journalist and author Rudy Abramson was a Washington correspondent for the Los Angeles Times for more than twenty-five years, during which time he served as national science correspondent, Pentagon correspondent, and White House correspondent. His major assignments included the U.S. space program, arms control policy, national political campaigns, the Watergate investigation, and environmental issues.Abramson is the author of Spanning the Century: The Life of W. Averell Harriman and Hallowed Ground: Preserving America&#39;s Heritage. He has written for Smithsonian Magazine, Audubon Magazine, Astronautics and Aeronautics Magazine, Encyclopaedia Britannica, the New York Times Book Review, and Appalachia.A graduate of the University of Mississippi, Abramson attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism as a Sloan-Rockefeller Fellow in Advanced Science Writing. He has also received a Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fellowship and an Alicia Patterson Fellowship. He is a native of Florence, Alabama.Jean Haskell retired as director and professor in the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East Tennessee State University. She is author of The Appalachian Photographs of Earl Palmer, co-editor of Performance, Culture, and Identity, and numerous other publications on Appalachian issues.Haskell has served in several capacities that promote Appalachian interests: as John D. Whisman Scholar with the Appalachian Regional Commission, Visiting Scholar with the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh, cultural resource advisor to the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the board of directors of the Appalachian Consortium, Friends of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance, as past president of the Appalachian Studies Association, and as curator of the Appalachian program for the 2003 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.Haskell holds B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Memphis and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin. She currently resides in Portsmouth, Virginia, where she is vice-president of Commodore Associates, Inc., owners and operators of the historic Commodore Theatre.The University of Tennessee Press received support from a number of companies, individuals, foundations, and organizations to fund the production of this comprehensive source of a major region of the U.S. The editors worked for almost 10 years on the project. Abramson is a journalist with the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>and a native of Alabama. Haskell is former director of and professor in the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East Tennessee State University. <p>The encyclopedia adopts the 2005 definition used by the Appalachian Regional Commission, describing Appalachia as consisting of 410 counties in 13 states from Mississippi to New York. The organization of the encyclopedia is thematic. There are five broad subject areas: "The Landscape," "The People," "Work and the Economy," "Cultural Traditions," and "Institutions." Each section begins with a five- to six-page introduction and is then subdivided into smaller subsections. "Work and the Economy" includes "Agriculture"; "Business, Industry and Technology"; "Labor"; "Tourism"; and "Transportation." Each subsection is an <i>A-Z</i> of people, places, and things. </p><p>The perception of Appalachia has been tarnished with numerous social, environmental, and economic problems, and the editors confront these as well as covering the positive aspects of the area. The 2,000 entries, written by more than 1,000 contributors from academia and journalism, include stereotypical topics (<i>Feuds</i>and <i>violence</i>, <i>Hillbilly</i>) but also subjects such as urban Appalachia and cultural institutions like the Pittsburgh Symphony. The entries are concise, well written, and readable both for the layperson and the scholar. </p><p>Although publicity for the encyclopedia advertises its ease of use, for a true reference source, a single alphabetical sequence would have improved quick access. The major finding aid, the general index, is sandwiched between the index of contributors and the photo credits. There are no color illustrations, and the black-and-white photographs do not really enhance the text. </p><p>This is an additional "area" encyclopedia but covers a larger section of the U.S. than other recent encyclopedias treating Chicago, New England, and New York. The editors and publisher are to be commended for completing a monumental work, and the reasonable price makes it a recommended purchase for all academic and large public libraries and also for high-school libraries in Appalachia. <i>Christine Bulson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But its spectacular moments of heaven-sent plagues and parting seas overshadow its true significance, says Jan Assmann, a leading historian of ancient religion. The story of Moses guiding the enslaved children of Israel out of captivity to become God's chosen people is the foundation of an entirely new idea of religion, one that lives on today in many of the world's faiths. <i>The Invention of Religion</i> sheds new light on ancient scriptures to show how Exodus has shaped fundamental understandings of monotheistic practice and belief.</p><p>Assmann delves into the enduring mythic power of the Exodus narrative, examining the text's compositional history and calling attention to distinctive motifs and dichotomies: enslavement and redemption; belief and doubt; proper worship and idolatry; loyalty and betrayal. Revelation is a central theme--the revelation of God's power in miracles, of God's presence in the burning bush, and of God's chosen dwelling among the Israelites in the vision of the tabernacle. Above all, it is God's covenant with Israel&#x2015;the binding obligation of the Israelites to acknowledge God as their redeemer and obey His law&#x2015;that is Exodus's most encompassing and transformative idea, one that challenged basic assumptions about humankind's relationship to the divine in the ancient world.</p><p><i>The Invention of Religion</i> is a powerful account of how ideas of faith, revelation, and covenant, first introduced in Exodus, shaped Judaism and were later adopted by Christianity and Islam to form the bedrock of the world's Abrahamic religions.</p></p><p><p>"In this bold reading of the Book of Exodus, Jan Assmann, one of the world's leading intellectuals, shows how Exodus preserves prebiblical Egyptian and Israelite memories while eliciting a &#x2018;monotheism of loyalty&#x2019; that has defined much of Western religion."<b>--David M. Carr, author of <i>The Formation of the Hebrew Bible</i></b></p><p>"In this brilliant, imaginative, and comprehensive study of the Book of Exodus, Jan Assmann draws on his extensive and nuanced knowledge of ancient civilizations, cultural memory, and biblical texts to make the case that the Exodus story of the liberation of a people is also the story of the unprecedented invention of a radically new conception of religion--one that became the basis for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The breadth and depth of Assmann's multifaceted explorations are dazzling."<b>--Richard J. Bernstein, New School for Social Research</b></p><p> "Jan Assmann's latest book is a blockbuster--beautifully written, capacious, learned, and endlessly creative. It is sure to become a touchstone for scholars and readers interested in the Bible, the ancient world, and the history of monotheism, past and present."<b>--Jonathan Sheehan, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p> "Jan Assmann, one of Germany's most influential historians and intellectuals, breaks new ground in <i>The Invention of Religion</i>. It is a remarkable achievement, one that promises to spark controversy."<b>--Jacob L. Wright, Emory University</b></p><b>Jan Assmann</b> is honorary professor of cultural studies at the University of Konstanz and professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Heidelberg, where he taught for nearly three decades.

Reissue.</p><p><p><i>Oedipus Rex</i> is the greatest of the Greek tragedies, a profound meditation on the human condition. The story of the mythological king, who is doomed to kill his father and marry his mother, has resonated in world culture for almost 2,500 years. But Sophocles&#x2019; drama as originally performed was much more than a great story&#x2014;it was a superb poetic script and exciting theatrical experience. The actors spoke in pulsing rhythms with hypnotic forward momentum, making it hard for audiences to look away. Interspersed among the verbal rants and duels were energetic songs performed by the chorus.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Mulroy&#x2019;s brilliant verse translation of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> recaptures the aesthetic power of Sophocles&#x2019; masterpiece while also achieving a highly accurate translation in clear, contemporary English. Speeches are rendered with the same kind of regular iambic rhythm that gave the Sophoclean originals their drive. The choral parts are translated as fluid rhymed songs. Mulroy also supplies an introduction, notes, and appendixes to provide helpful context for general readers and students.Considered by many the greatest of the classic Greek tragedies, <i>Oedipus Rex</i> is Sophocles' finest play and a work of extraordinary power and resonance. Aristotle considered it a masterpiece of dramatic construction and refers to it frequently in the <i>Poetics</i>.<br>In presenting the story of King Oedipus and the tragedy that ensues when he discovers he has inadvertently killed his father and married his mother, the play exhibits near-perfect harmony of character and action. Moreover, the masterly use of dramatic irony greatly intensifies the impact of the agonizing events and emotions experienced by Oedipus and the other characters in the play. Now these and many other facets of this towering tragedy may be studied and appreciated in Dover's attractive inexpensive edition of one of the great landmarks of Western drama.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p><h2>Beyond Design: The Synergy of Apparel Product Development</h2><p>This practical text takes students step-by-step through the pre-production processes of apparel product development: planning, forecasting, fabricating, line development, technical design, pricing, and sourcing.

Arguing against moral judgments and political, economic, or social commentary, he wrote, &#x201c;To describe . . . you need . . . to free yourself from the personal expression. . . . Subjectivity is a terrible thing.&#x201d; Instead, he favored objectivity, truthfulness, originality, compassion, and brevity.

As brutal as his father was, he was not stupid, and he insisted on the education of his children, assuming as a matter of course that his sons would somehow go on to university. And, dogmatic in his religious beliefs, he had a substantial collection of religious books that indicate his faith was informed by study. But Pavel Egorovich had bad luck. Circumstances beyond his control-a newly built railroad shifted the entire economy of the town to his drastic disadvantage-led to his having to close the grocery shop and to his escaping to Moscow, where his two elder sons were already studying, to avoid debtors' prison. There, he was only able to find work as a clerk in a warehouse (how interesting that Laptev in "Three Years" remembers working in a warehouse!), and his will was broken. It was at this point that his son Anton took over the responsibility of the family. </p><p>Anton was sixteen, the same age as his father when he was freed from being a serf. Still a student in Tanganrog, he sold family furniture to pay for the fare of his mother and a younger brother and sister to Moscow, and, though not a very brilliant student himself, he tutored other students to earn money to send to his family. He seemed, too, to take on the moral as well as the financial guidance of his family. </p><p>From Taganrog, he wrote to his younger brother Mishka, rather condescendingly: "You write well, and in the whole letter I have not found a single mistake in spelling," then, with moral authority, he lectured: "But there is one thing I do not like: why do you call yourself 'your worthless and insignificant brother?' . . . Recognize it before God; perhaps, too, in the presence of beauty, wisdom, nature, but not before men. Among men you must be conscious of your dignity and worth" (<i>Letters on the Short Story</i>, p. 291). </p><p>Later, when he was himself living with his family in Moscow in a half basement apartment and attending the faculty of medicine at the University, he continued to help support the family: He added to the insufficient earnings of his father by writing what he called "stories, tales, vaudevilles, any sort of rubbish" (<i>Life and Letters</i>, p. 4) for periodicals. He had been introduced to editors by his older brother Alexander, who himself wrote for the periodicals, but Alexander and the next older brother Nikolai, a painter, had already taken to the drink that destroyed them. </p><p>If, in becoming the financial and moral force of the family, Anton had taken on the tenacity of his father's will, he also became essentially different from him-in reaction, I'm tempted to say, to free himself from his father's dogmatic will. Anton had developed into a light-spirited, witty fellow who amused others with "all sorts of pranks and inventions" (<i>Life and Letters</i>, p. 3); he had become liberal; and he no longer believed in the religion that had been inculcated in him. And, unlike his father, Anton never imposed his will on anyone. </p><p>In a sense, his was a negative will, for, absolute as it was, it kept him from imposing himself not only on others but on the characters of his fiction-he refused, in the name of what he believed to be absolute freedom from tyranny, to judge. He was as strict as his father was, though not in insisting on a dominating ideology; on the contrary, he insisted on freedom from any such ideology.</p></p><h2>Waves (Berkeley Physics Course, Vol. 3)</h2><p>Volume III entirely devoted to the study of waves.

But what do we really know about those who live on &#x201c;easy street&#x201d;? In this penetrating book, Rachel Sherman draws on rare in-depth interviews that she conducted with fifty affluent New Yorkers&#x2015;including hedge fund financiers and corporate lawyers, professors and artists, and stay-at-home mothers&#x2015;to examine their lifestyle choices and their understanding of privilege. Sherman upends images of wealthy people as invested only in accruing and displaying social advantages for themselves and their children. Instead, these liberal elites, who believe in diversity and meritocracy, feel conflicted about their position in a highly unequal society. They wish to be &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; describing their consumption as reasonable and basic and comparing themselves to those who have more than they do rather than those with less. These New Yorkers also want to see themselves as hard workers who give back and raise children with good values, and they avoid talking about money.</p><p>Although their experiences differ depending on a range of factors, including whether their wealth was earned or inherited, these elites generally depict themselves as productive and prudent, and therefore morally worthy, while the undeserving rich are lazy, ostentatious, and snobbish. Sherman argues that this ethical distinction between &#x201c;good&#x201d; and &#x201c;bad&#x201d; wealthy people characterizes American culture more broadly, and that it perpetuates rather than challenges economic inequality.</p><p>As the distance between rich and poor widens, <i>Uneasy Street</i> not only explores the real lives of those at the top but also sheds light on how extreme inequality comes to seem ordinary and acceptable to the rest of us.</p></p><p><p>"At a time of growing class inequality, how do the wealthy grapple with their privileged economic position? In <i>Uneasy Street</i>, Sherman offers a remarkable look inside the world of affluence and shows how the liberal elite struggles to attain moral worthiness. This book skillfully advances our understanding of social class and makes an important contribution to the sociology of money."<b>--Viviana A. Zelizer, author of <i>Economic Lives</i></b></p><p>"Sherman transcends the cartoon caricatures of the wealthy to provide a profound and nuanced picture of the lived experience of affluent New Yorkers. <i>Uneasy Street</i> is an original and insightful look at the complex ambivalence that many wealthy people feel in a time of extreme inequality and the narratives they sometimes tell themselves to rationalize, justify, or ignore their wealth and advantage."<b>--Chuck Collins, author of <i>Born on Third Base</i></b></p><p>"<i>Uneasy Street</i> looks at how rich people talk about the choices they make about money, and how that talk constructs a moral universe in which they can claim legitimacy for their advantages. This book is full of astute observations and sensitive interpretations, and its argument is new and profoundly important."<b>--Allison J. Pugh, University of Virginia</b></p><p>"This exceptionally interesting book examines how one group of wealthy people understands and experiences its extraordinary privilege. Sherman's analysis of elites is long overdue, especially as the popular discourse on inequality has exploded. Beautifully written, <i>Uneasy Street</i> is an exceptional piece of work."<b>--Juliet Schor, author of <i>True Wealth</i></b></p><b>Rachel Sherman</b> is associate professor of sociology at the New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College.

Writing with undergraduates in mind, Wiles especially relies upon solid interpretation coupled with modern analogies and engages the reader in a meaningful way. Taking her cue from the notion that what may be familiar may not necessarily be understood, Wiles shows how assuming knowledge of Paul's thought world and language leads to confusion and misunderstanding. Thus "familiar" terms such as <i>righteousness, sin, law,</i> and <i>grace</i> take on a new dimension under Wiles's guiding hand. Paul's experience of God is also factored in as a very real dimension of his relationship with God. Wiles thinks once we are able to appreciate Paul in his own context, then Paul's writings offer lessons about human existence for believer and nonbeliever alike.<p><i>"Making Sense of Paul</i> is a refreshingly insightful and splendid attempt to allow the complexity of the Apostle's theology to become intelligible both for the beginner as well as for the mature learner. Even those who might wish to place the emphases at different points in Paul's thought will profit from the lucidity of expression and the use of consistently thought-provoking and helpful illustrations. This magnificent little gem fills a huge void in Pauline literature and rightly will find very wide usage."<br>-Karl Paul Donfried, Professor and Chair, Department of Religion and Biblical Literature, Smith College</p></p><p>Virginia Wiles is associate professor of New Testament at New Brunswick Theological Seminary.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>Clever Girl Finance: Ditch debt, save money and build real wealth</h2><p><p><b>Take charge of your finances and achieve financial independence &#x2013; the <i>Clever Girl </i>way</b></p> <p>Join the ranks of thousands of smart and savvy women who have turned to money expert and author Bola Sokunbi for guidance on ditching debt, saving money, and building real wealth.

We live in a world of vivid colors, and color marks our psychological and social existence. But for all color&#x2019;s inescapability, we don&#x2019;t know much about it. Now authors David Scott Kastan and Stephen Farthing offer a fresh and imaginative exploration of one of the most intriguing and least understood aspects of everyday experience.<br><br> Kastan and Farthing, a scholar and a painter, respectively, investigate color from numerous perspectives: literary, historical, cultural, anthropological, philosophical, art historical, political, and scientific. In ten lively and wide-ranging chapters, each devoted to a different color, they examine the various ways colors have shaped and continue to shape our social and moral imaginations. Each individual color becomes the focal point for a consideration of one of the extraordinary ways in which color appears and matters in our lives. Beautifully produced in full color, this book is a remarkably smart, entertaining, and fascinating guide to this elusive topic.</p><p><b>David Scott Kastan</b>, the George M.

Beginning with his birth on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Douglass&#x2019;s account records the tyranny and brutality of his life in slavery until his ultimate escape to New Bedford, Massachusetts, at the age of twenty.</p><p>Published in 1845&#x2014;just seven years after his escape&#x2014;Douglass&#x2019;s narrative sold five thousand copies in its first four months in print.

Douglass, who taught himself to read and write, gave many speeches against slavery and was the author of three autobiographies. Douglass also became active in politics, successfully campaigning to make ending slavery a key issue in the Civil War and to allow black soldiers to fight in the Union army. His belief in equality for all continued after the war, as he fought for African American rights and became an active supporter of women&#x2019;s suffrage until his death.</p></p><h2>Inside the Mind of Vladimir Putin</h2><p>The Russian president's landmark speeches, interviews and policies borrow heavily from great Russian thinkers past and present, from Peter the Great to Dostoevsky and Solzhenitsyn. They offer powerful visions of strong leaders and the Russian nation: they value conservatism and the Slavic spirit. They root morality in Orthodoxy, and Russian identity in the historic struggle with the West.<br><br>Today, Putin manages and manipulates those same ideas in his 'defense' of 130 million ethnic Russians against the world. With the annexation of Crimea, the war in Syria and shock election results across the West, the challenge of decrypting his worldview has become more pressing than ever. From a Eurasian Union to a new Russian Empire, this is a revealing tour of Kremlin doctrine and strategy, viewed through its philosophical roots.<br></p><p><br>Michel Eltchaninoff is an award-winning French writer who has lived in Moscow.

Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

Talking about the problem only intensified his rage. Going into the Christian ministry didn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t help either, the guilt merely magnified his despair. Facing a charge of attempted murder and a prison term, Hegstrom got the wake-up call he needed. With professional help and an intense struggle with spiritual issues, he began the lengthy process of healing and recovery.Through a fascinating, yet thorough examination of the psychological components of various types of abuse, along with true examples from his own life and others, Hegstrom points the way back to wholeness and freedom. An invaluable aid for the man who batters, the woman who feels trapped, and the pastor, counselor, or friend who desperately wants to help them both, Angry Men and the Women Who Love Them offers straight answers for those willing to overcome the cycle of violence. The revised and updated edition includes a new chapter that discusses the physiological and psychological changes in the brain when abuse occurs.</p><p>Paul Hegstrom is the founder of Life Skills International, a program designed to teach life skills to individuals with unacceptable behaviors and enhance family relationships through nurturing character and maturity. Paul holds a Bachelor of Science degree in pastoral counseling and a Ph.D. in marriage and family therapy. He is a certified cognitive behavioral therapist with the National Board of Cognitive Behavioral Therapists and has been featured by such national media as USA Today, Focus on the Family, The 700 Club, The Montel Williams Show, and The Coral Ridge Hour. Paul and Judy Hegstrom&#x2019;s story was featured in the 1995 CBS movie, Unforgivable: The Life Story of Paul Hegstrom, which starred John Ritter.</p><h2>Hawthorn: The Tree That Has Nourished, Healed, and Inspired Through the Ages</h2><p><b>An engaging introduction to the ancient hawthorn tree and its varied roles in human history</b><br><br> One of humankind&#x2019;s oldest companions, the hawthorn tree is bound up in the memories of every recorded age and the plot lines of cultures across the Northern Hemisphere. In <i>Hawthorn,</i> Bill Vaughn examines the little-recognized political, cultural, and natural history of this ancient spiky plant. Used for thousands of years in the impenetrable living fences that defined the landscapes of Europe, the hawthorn eventually helped feed the class antagonism that led to widespread social upheaval. In the American Midwest, hawthorn-inspired hedges on the prairies made nineteenth-century farming economically rewarding for the first time. Later, in Normandy, mazelike hedgerows bristling with these thorns nearly cost the Allies World War II. Vaughn shines light on the full scope of the tree&#x2019;s influence over human events. He also explores medicinal value of the hawthorn, the use of its fruit in the world&#x2019;s first wine, and the symbolic role its spikes and flowers played in pagan beliefs and Christian iconography. As entertaining as it is illuminating, this book is the first full appreciation of the hawthorn&#x2019;s abundant connections with humanity.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Bill Vaughn</b> writes for many publications about topics ranging from sports to the paper industry, fashion to the cattle business. He lives outside Missoula, MT.&#x201c;This jack-of-all-trees story makes for a compelling read, spiced with arcane history and Vaughn&#x2019;s own anecdotes.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Science News</i> (<i>Science News</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Wow! This is quite extraordinary.... I was absolutely riveted from the first paragraph. Vaughn&#x2019;s writing is often deeply literary, but at the same time, one can see the wheels of an innate environmentalist turning in intricate circles, sketching out a narrative that is by turns thoughtful, funny, informative, and even astonishing.&#x201d;&#x2014;Daniel Lewis, Huntington Library (Daniel Lewis 2014-08-15)<br><br>&#x201c;Bill Vaughn romps through the thickets and hedgerows of biology and culture, emerging with fascinating tales about an unjustly neglected species.&#x201d;&#x2014;David George Haskell, author of <i>The Forest Unseen</i> (David George Haskell 2014-09-26)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Hawthorn </i>is a delightful book about a tree that has deeply influenced European and American landscapes and cultures.

The book is exceedingly original and the author does an excellent job weaving together a wide range of material.&#x201d;&#x2014;Todd A. Forrest, The New York Botanical Garden (Todd A. Forest 2014-08-14)<br><br>&#x201c;Vaughn is clearly captivated by the hawthorn, both as a natural phenomenon, and as a mythic force . . . Call it a gentle madness if you will, but I recommend sharing it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Laurence Marschall, <i>Natural History</i> (Laurence Marschall <i>Natural History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In other hands, this book could be a mess as tangled as its subject.

Supremely aware of the power of his position, Mouret seeks to exploit the desire that his luxuriantly displayed merchandise arouses in the ladies who shop, and the aspirations of the young female assistants he employs. Charting the beginnings of the capitalist economy and bourgeois society, Zola captures in lavish detail the greedy customers and gossiping staff, and the obsession with image, fashion, and gratification that was a phenomenon of nineteenth-century French consumer society. Of all Zola's novels, this may be the one with the most relevance for our own time.</p><p><b>�mile Zola</b> (1840-1902) was the leading figure in the French school of naturalistic fiction.

Andrei is a model Soviet citizen, a swaggeringly self-satisfied mogul of the food industry who intends to revolutionize modern life with mass-produced sausage. Nikolai is a loser. Finding him drunk in the gutter, Andrei gives him a bed for the night and a job as a gofer. Nikolai takes what he can, but that doesn't mean he's grateful. Griping, sulking, grovelingly abject, he despises everything Andrei believes in, even if he envies him his every breath.<br><br>Producer and sponger, insider and outcast, master and man fight back and forth in the pages of Olesha's anarchic comedy. It is a contest of wills in which nothing is sure except the incorrigible human heart.<br><br>Marian Schwartz's new English translation of <i>Envy</i> brilliantly captures the energy of Olesha's masterpiece.</p><p><b>Yuri Olesha</b> (1899&#x2013;1960), the son of an impoverished land-owner who spent his days playing cards, grew up in Odessa, a lively multicultural city whose literary scene also included Isaac Babel. Olesha made his name as a writer with&nbsp;<i>Three Fat Men,</i>&nbsp;a proletarian fairy tale, and had an even greater success with&nbsp;<i>Envy</i>in 1927. Soon, however, the ambiguous nature of the novella&#x2019;s depiction of the new revolutionary era led to complaints from high, followed by the collapse of his career and the disappearance of his books. In 1934, Olesha addressed the First Congress of Soviet Writers, arguing that a writer should be allowed the freedom to choose his own style and themes. For the rest of his life he wrote very little.

Bateson has come to this position during a career that carried him not only into anthropology, for which he was first trained, but into psychiatry, genetics, and communication theory. . . .

It is the conscious Presence that is aware of this current experience. As such, it is nothing that can be experienced as an object, and yet it is undeniably present.</p><p>However, these contemplations go much further than this. As we take our stand knowingly as this conscious Presence that we always already are, and reconsider the objects of the body, mind, and world, we find that they do not simply appear&nbsp;<i>to</i>&nbsp;this Presence; they appear&nbsp;<i>within</i>&nbsp;it. And further exploration reveals that they do not simply appear&nbsp;<i>within</i>&nbsp;this Presence but&nbsp;<i>as</i>&nbsp;this Presence.</p><p>Finally, we are led to see that it is in fact this very Presence that takes the shape of our experience from moment to moment while always remaining only itself. We see that our experience is and has only ever been one seamless totality, with no separate entities, objects, or parts anywhere to be found.</p></p><p>From an early age, <b>Rupert Spira</b> was deeply interested in the nature of reality. At the age of seventeen he learned to meditate, and began a twenty-year period of study and practice in the classical Advaita Vedanta tradition under the guidance of Dr. Francis Roles and Shantananda Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of the north of India. During this time, Spira immersed himself in the teachings of P. D. Ouspensky, Krishnamurti, Rumi, Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and Robert Adams, until he met his teacher, Francis Lucille, in 1997. Lucille introduced Spira to the Direct Path teachings of Atmananda Krishna Menon, the Tantric tradition of Kashmir Shaivism (which he had received from his teacher, Jean Klein), and, more importantly, directly indicated to him the true nature of experience. Spira lives in the UK and holds regular meetings and retreats in Europe and the United States.&#x201c;A transparent book by a transparent being.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Francis Lucille</b>, author of <i>Eternity Now</i>, <i>The Perfume of&nbsp;Silence</i>, and <i>Truth Love Beauty</i><br><br>&#x201c;Recognition of our true nature does not need studious reading of spiritual texts, years of meditation practice, or deep devotion to a teacher. We need only the willingness to engage in a rigorously honest investigation into the nature of awareness itself&#x2014;not an intellectual investigation, but a personal investigation into what we truly are. In&nbsp;<i>The Transparency of Things</i>, Rupert Spira not only distils the essence of this inquiry into everyday language; he does so without reference to any metaphysics or esoteric doctrines. He appeals only to our direct experience, encouraging the reader to dive into the personal investigation of what it means to be aware.

Chafee was an unrepentant modernist on the forefront of sustainable design. Her architecture shows great sensitivity to place, especially the desert landscapes of Arizona. Chafee was also a social justice advocate and a highly respected woman in a male-dominated profession. After graduating from the Yale University Architecture School, where her advisor was Paul Rudolph, she went on to work in the offices of legends including Rudolph, Walter Gropius, Eero Saarinen, and Edward Larrabee Barnes.

Bullitt</h2><p>Depicts the life of the distinguished ambassador and examines his influence on the development of American foreign policy</p><p>Bullitt was referred to by Walter Lippmann as "the sharpest of the American correspondents" covering World War I. Later, he coauthored with Sigmund Freud a psychological study of Woodrow Wilson. There were, however, relatively minor accomplishments in the sparkling career of William Bullitt, remembered today as the diplomatic prodigy who was President Wilson's emissary to Lenin at age 28; FDR's first ambassador to Moscow at 42; and ambassador to France during the crucial years 19361940. Both intelligent and charming, Bullitt's remarkable ability to "see into the future" led to his warnings about the inherent dangers of the Versailles Treaty, problems with the Soviet Union, the world-threatening potential of atomic weaponry and the commitment of U.S. ground forces to Indochina. Billings, coauthor of The Plot to Kill the President, and historian Brownell contend that Bullitt's gratuitous criticism of undersecretary of state Sumner Welles (who allegedly propositioned a railroad porter) ruined Bullitt's career, and that he otherwise might have become "a superlative secretary of state who could have stopped Stalin in Central Europe and avoided the Cold War."

He transformed Gucci from a moribund accessories label into one of the sexiest fashion brands in the world. His designs have increased sales at Gucci tenfold and have helped build the Gucci brand into the luxury goods conglomerate that it is today. Ford brought a hard-edged style synonymous with 21st century glamour to his clothes, and Hollywood sat up and took note. This book is a complete catalogue of Ford's design work for both Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent from 1994 to 2004. It chronicles not only Ford's clothing and accessories designs for both houses, but also explores Ford's grand vision for the complete design of a brand, including architecture, store design, and advertising. <i>Tom Ford</i> features more than 200 photographs by Richard Avedon, Mario Testino, Steven Meisel, Helmut Newton, Herb Ritts, Terry Richardson, Craig McDean, Todd Eberle, and numerous other photographers including many previously unpublished images. Published to coincide with his departure from Gucci, this book has been created with Ford's full cooperation and every page reflects his exceptional taste. It is Ford's testament to a career of singular moments reinventing the boundaries of style and sensuality in clothing.</p><p><b>Bridget Foley </b>has always loved storytelling. She's the author of several screenplays and is often featured on annual industry best-of lists. "Hugo &amp; Rose" is her first novel.<br><br><b>Tom Ford </b>has been showered with design awards in recent years, including 3 awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, 5 VH1/ <i>Vogue </i>Fashion Awards, <i>British GQ </i>International Man of the Year, and Designer of the Year by <i>GQ America</i>.<br><br><b>Anna Wintour</b> is the editor of <i>American Vogue</i>.<br><br><b>Graydon Carter</b> has been the editor-in-chief of <i>Vanity Fair</i> since 1992.

He is the producer of the acclaimed film <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i>&nbsp;and the executive producer of the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning documentary <i>9/11.</i> He lives in New York.This enormous compendium may be Ford's swan song as a designer, as he recently announced that he was quitting fashion to direct movies. But for the last 10 years, as the creative director at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, he took the brands in fresh directions. This huge, slipcased Festschrift checks in at 11"�14", and covers each of the Gucci years individually, compiling product shots, ads, runway candids, snippets of Ford wisdom ("I think you have to have personality at a brand&#x2014;otherwise, it's just clothes"), Gucci-sporting celebrities and commercial stills. <i>Vogue</i>'s Anna Wintour and <i>Vanity Fair</i>'s Graydon Carter contribute a foreword and introduction respectively. The much-covered growth at Gucci and YSL are the real story behind the book, to the point where the press chat credits Ford with "carving out a new industry archetype: the businessman designer." But the 375 color and b&amp;w photos, all culled from existing fashion archives, is more of a look back at how Ford's creations were presented (including year-by-year portraits of the photogenic Ford himself), rather than what led to their creation, how they were actually made or how they fit into the culture at large. As a 10-year time capsule of brand fashioning, the book succeeds perfectly. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

More than ninety years later this work remains, as Vincent Tomas observed, one of the most rigorous attacks on formalism and on the doctrine of art for art's sake ever written. Tomas's Introduction makes this the edition of choice for students of aesthetics and anyone with philosophical interests.</p></p><p>A major and provocative work of criticism by the author of <i>Anna Karenina </i>and <i>War and Peace.</i>During the decades of his world fame as sage and preacher as well as author of War and Peace and Anna Karenin, Tolstoy wrote prolifically in a series of essays and polemics on issues of morality, social justice and religion. These culminated in What is Art?, published in 1898. Although Tolstoy perceived the question of art to be a religious one, he considered and rejected the idea that art reveals and reinvents through beauty. The works of Dante, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Baudelaire and even his own novels are condemned in the course of Tolstoy&#39;s impassioned and iconoclastic redefinition of art as a force for good, for the progress and improvement of mankind. In his illuminating preface Richard Pevear considers What is Art? in relation to the problems of faith and doubt, and the spiritual anguish and fear of death which preoccupied Tolstoy in the last decades of his life.</p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of College Algebra, 4th Edition (Schaum&#39;s Outlines)</h2><p><p><b>Tough Test Questions?

These profound yet accessible instructions focus on becoming familiar with the nature of one&#x2019;s mind as the primary means to realize ultimate reality and thus attain buddhahood. Dakpo Tashi Namgyal&#x2019;s manual for the view and practice of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; is widely considered the single most important work on the subject, systematically introducing the view and associated meditation techniques in a progressive manner.<br><br>Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;, along with the Ninth Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje&#x2019;s Dispelling the Darkness of Ignorance, are to this day some of the most studied texts on Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; in the Kagyu monasteries throughout Tibet and the Himalayas. Elizabeth M. Callahan, a renowned translator of classical Kagyu literature, has provided new translations of these two texts along with ancillary materials and annotations, making this a genuine resource for both scholars and students of Tibetan Buddhism. This historic contribution therefore offers the necessary tools to properly study and apply the Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; teachings in a modern context.</p><p>Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (1513&#x2013;1587) was the first recognized reincarnation of Gampopa and an important master of the Dakpo Kagyu tradition. He wrote two highly acclaimed texts on Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; practice: Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; and Clarifying the Natural State.<br><br>Elizabeth M. Callahan is a Tibetan translator of the Kagyu tradition. She completed two three-year retreats at Kagyu Thubten Ch�ling in New York, is a student of Khenpo Ts�ltrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, and has been a Tsadra Foundation Fellow since 2002. Her previous translations include The Treasury of Knowledge: Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy by Jamg�n Kongtrul and The Profound Inner Reality by the Third Karmapa Rangjung Dorje.&#x201c;This remarkable text, Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;, contains the essence of the entire Buddhist tradition as it has come to us from India and Tibet. The author, Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, clearly lays out the profound path of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; with both the analytical style of a scholar and the experiential style of a meditator. This unique approach is, at the same time, profound, practical, and completely accessible. It is my sincere wish that this new translation will inspire and benefit all who encounter it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche<br><br>&#x201c;Dakpo Tashi Namgyal&#x2019;s Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; is a fine piece of traditional scholarship that is, at the same time, a clear manual for beginners as well as advanced Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; meditation practitioners. With her extensive introduction and new annotated translation of Moonbeams, Elizabeth M. Callahan renders an enormous service for scholars and practitioners alike. The introduction does not only cover a comprehensive history of the relevant transmission lineages, but also discusses in an academically balanced and well-documented way the major issues of current research, such as the controversy around the attempts to justify s&#x16b;tra-based Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;. The new translation of Moonbeams profits from Callahan&#x2019;s exemplary mastery of classical Tibetan philology as well as her long-standing experience of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; meditation. This rare combination of skills shines throughout the highly readable text, making Dakpo Tashi Namgyal&#x2019;s Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; classic for the first time easily accessible.&#x201d;&#x2014;Klaus-Dieter Mathes, Professor of Buddhist Studies, University of Vienna<br><br>&#x201c;Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;, the &#x201c;great seal&#x201d; of empty and blissful awareness, was a crucial concept and meditative practice in late Indian Buddhism and lies at the very heart of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. No Kagyu text on the great seal is more important that Dakpo Tashi Namgyal&#x2019;s Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;, and with Elizabeth Callahan&#x2019;s superb new translation, this masterwork receives the full scholarly treatment it deserves. Her fresh translation of the shorter but equally influential Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;: Dispelling the Darkness of Ignorance, by the Ninth Karmapa, only adds to the richness of this spiritual and intellectual feast&#x2014;which will be savored by any scholar or practitioner seeking a lucid explanation of some of the deepest explorations the nature of mind and reality ever undertaken.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Jackson, Professor Emeritus of Asian Studies and Religion, Carleton College <br><br>"<i>Moonbeams of Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101;</i> is not only a meditation instruction manual but a lucid explanation of Ground, Path, and Result Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; in the context of the Buddhist path. Dakpo Tashi Namgyal taught it so well that he came to be known as the reincarnation of Gampopa. Elizabeth Callahan spent her entire life studying and translating Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; texts. There is no doubt that anybody who wishes to study Mah&#x101;mudr&#x101; will need to read this book."&#x2014;Ringu Tulku</p><h2>Peterson Reference Guide To Sparrows Of North America (Peterson Reference Guides)</h2><p><b>Sparrows are as complicated as they are common.

It is the foremost English-language edition of the great poet.</strong></p> The peerless translations of this haunted and haunting Holocaust poet, including ten new poems and an illuminating essay by the translator. Paul Celan is one the twentieth century's most essential poets, and twenty-two years after its publication, Poems of Paul Celan continues to be the single truest access for English-speakers to this poet's work. This new edition adds ten more poems and a significant essay, "On Translating Celan" by Michael Hamburger.</p><p>George Steiner has declared, "The quality of aloneness in Celan is pitiless." Paul Celan's hermetic, Holocaust-haunted works call out to us and then resort to difficulty, private language, and--in the late art--splintering and silence. Celan, who committed suicide in 1970, was born in Romania and wrote in a German taut with archetypes, archaisms, and neologisms, which has both frustrated and inspired fellow poets and translators. Michael Hamburger has been more daring than most. Laboring on a dual-language selection, he had to resort to biographical clues to unravel entire poems; he bluntly states that "much of Celan's later poetry can be intuitively grasped, but not rendered in another language, without as much knowledge as possible of his sources.... What makes them difficult is the terrain itself--a terrain in which milk is black, death is the all-encompassing reality--not the nature of its charting." <p> The reference is to Celan's most famous work, "Todesfuge" ("Death Fugue"), a poem which grows more harrowing with each reading, particularly the iconic lines "death is a master from Germany his eyes are blue / he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true." Hamburger's translation begins: </p><blockquote> Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown<br> we drink it at noon and in the morning we drink it at night<br> we drink and we drink it<br> we dig a grave in the breezes there lies one unconfined... </blockquote> Though this is among Celan's more accessible works, most of the poems in Hamburger's volume will reward, and stun, the attentive reader.<p><b>Paul Celan</b> was a poet and translator born in the East European province of Bukovina. Soon after his parents, German-speaking Jews, had perished at the hands of the Nazis, Celan wrote the poem "Todesfuge" ("Deathfugue"), which depicted life in a German concentration camp.</p><p>Michael Hamburger (1924-2007) wrote many collections of poetry and criticism. Other notable translations include Baudelaire's <em>Twenty Prose Poems</em>. He received the European Translation Prize for&nbsp;<em>Poems of Paul Celan</em>.</p></p><h2>Richard Wright : Later Works: Black Boy (American Hunger), The Outsider</h2><p><i>Native Son</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Black Boy</i>&nbsp;are classics of twentieth-century American literature&#x2014;and yet the novel and memoir known to millions of readers are in fact revised and abbreviated versions of the books Richard Wright wrote. The two-volume Library of America edition presents for the first time Wright&#x2019;s major works in the form in which he intended them to be read. The authoritative new texts, based on Wright&#x2019;s original typescripts and proofs, reveal the full range and power of this achievement as an experimental stylist and as a fiery prophet of the tragic consequences of racism in American society.<br><br>Wright&#x2019;s wrenching memoir&nbsp;<i>Black Boy</i>, an eloquent account of his struggle to escape a life of poverty, ignorance and fear in his native South, was an immediate bestseller when it appeared in 1945. But Wright&#x2019;s complete autobiography, published for the first time in this volume as&nbsp;<i>Black Boy (American Hunger)</i>, is a far more complex and probing work. Its original second section, in which Wright chronicled his encounter with racism in the North, his apprenticeship as a writer, and his disillusionment with the Communist Party, was cut at the insistence of book club editors and was only published posthumously as a separate work. Now that the two parts of Wright&#x2019;s autobiography are finally printed together,&nbsp;<i>Black Boy (American Hunger)</i>&nbsp;appears as a new and different work&#x2014;a unique contribution to the literature of self-discovery and a searing vision of racism in Northern slums as well as Southern shanties.<br><br>Richard Wright&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>The Outsider</i>&nbsp;(1953) appears here in a text that restores the many stylistic changes and long cuts made by his editors without his knowledge. This text, based on Wright&#x2019;s final, corrected typescript, casts new light on his development of the style he called &#x201c;poetic realism.&#x201d; The &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; of Wright&#x2019;s story is Cross Damon, a black man who works in the Chicago post office. When Damon is mistakenly believed to have died in a subway accident, he seizes the opportunity to invent a new life for himself. In this, his most philosophical novel, Wright reconsiders the existentialist themes of man&#x2019;s freedom and responsibility as he traces Damon&#x2019;s doomed attempts to lead a free life.<br><br>Richard Wright was &#x201c;forged in injustice as a sword is forged,&#x201d; wrote Ernest Hemingway. With passionate honesty and courage, he confronted the terrible effects of prejudice and intolerance and created works that explore the deepest conflicts of the human heart.<br><br>This volume includes notes on significant changes in Wright&#x2019;s texts and a detailed chronology of his life.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Determined to keep herself alive in the DA's office, Sara is coerced by colleagues to take a case that will tie her up in trial for months. But what she doesn't know is that the case -- intended for a senior staffer -- is not what it appears to be: an apparently routine burglary hides a deadly conspiracy. <p>Meanwhile, Sara's husband Jared, a defense lawyer, has been warned by his superiors that he needs to bring in new clients or he won't make partner. When asked by a corporate heavyweight to defend a petty burglary, Jared jumps at the chance to bring a wealthy new client to the firm. But soon, Jared discovers that he's been set up. The criminal he's defending is the same one Sara is set to prosecute. Worse yet, both Jared and Sara receive vicious threats that will soon put their relationship in the ultimate form of peril: win the case at all costs or the other will die.</p></p><h2>Corrective Reading Decoding a Word Attack Basics Teacher Presentation</h2><p>Builds student background a component of the print experience that enables teachers to model student responses and build background knowledge and piques interest</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Ephesians (Life Application Bible Commentary)</h2><p>The Life Application Bible Commentary series is the only commentary to offer sermon and lesson applications alongside stirring commentary.

Dr. Ross and his family live in southern California.Ross (Creation and Time, NavPr., 1994) offers a variation on the argument proving the existence of God. He first examines the implications of the newest discoveries in quantum and particle physics that demonstrate the existence of more than four dimensions. Building also on Einstein's general and special theories of relativity, the author shows that science can not only point the way to the existence of the Creator but can also show that God is and has always been able to operate in all the universe's possible dimensions. Ross applies this extra-dimensionality of God to explain the apparent paradoxes of several theological doctrines (e.g., the Incarnation, the Trinity, free will and predestination, etc.). His blending of theology and science seeks to address the claim made by Paul Davies in his God and the New Physics (1984) that modern science provides a more convincing proof of God's existence than religion. But he weakens his argument by trying to interpret scripture in terms of science. A more successful response to this claim is found in Science, Technology and Religious Ideas (Univ. Pr. of America, 1994), which acknowledges the integrity of each methodology.

The story concerned the emotional and sexual awakening of a young English woman traveling abroad, and bristled with social commentary on issues as varied as homosexuality, the suffrage movement, and colonialism. She was warned by colleagues, however, that publishing an outspoken indictment of Britain could prove disastrous to her fledgling career as a novelist. Moreover, the critical offensive from men would be especially harsh towards a woman author. Woolf thus revised the novel extensively, omitting much of the political candor until, in 1915, the quieter book was published under the title The Voyage Out. The Cleis Press publication of Melymbrosia offers a rare look into the formative mind of the modernist master who revolutionized twentieth century literature. Here, one sees the young Virginia Woolf learning her craft. Like James Joyce&#x2019;s Stephen Hero, the original treatment of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, or Ralph Ellison&#x2019;s posthumously published Juneteenth, Melymbrosia is a "lost classic" that owes its existence to the research of a devoted scholar. In this instance, editor and Woolf authority Louise DeSalvo (Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work) spent seven years reviewing more than 1,000 manuscript pages from Woolf&#x2019;s private papers. DeSalvo had no clear markers for proceeding to the finished draft, save for Woolf&#x2019;s remarks on the novel&#x2019;s progress, plot, and structure in her diaries. But also, the editor resourcefully relied upon clues among the papers themselves, including color of ink and paper color, where pencil or pen left off and began anew, and even the color of ribbon Woolf used to bundle manuscript pages. In short, the puzzle of Melymbrosia was eventually solved through the ingenuity and persistence of meticulous research.</p><p>"Melymbrosia is as covertly and as fiercely seditious as many of Jane Austen's novels... No matter how accomplished and risk-taking this first novel was, Woolf continually expressed fears about publishing it, about having it seen, exposed, and criticized. To her sister Vanessa Bell, she wrote that she hid her manuscript whenever anyone entered a room and she wondered if she would ever dare print it..."&#x2014;Louise DeSalvo, from the IntroductionVirginia Woolf was born in 1882 London. Following the death of her father, Woolf moved with her sister Vanessa and two brothers to the house in Bloomsbury. In 1905, Woolf began to write for the Times Literary Supplement. She composed her first novel, Melymbrosia, from 1909 to 1912. In 1912, she met and married Leonard Woolf, with whom she founded the Hogarth Press. In 1915, Gerald Duckworth published a later version of Melymbrosia under the title The Voyage Out. <p>Between the two World Wars, Virginia Woolf was at the center of The Bloomsbury group, which included E.M. Forster, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, Vanessa Bell, and Duncan Grant, among others. In 1926, Woolf began a passionate romance with writer Vita Sackville-West, for whom she wrote Orlando. </p><p>In 1895 and 1915, Virginia Woolf suffered mental breakdowns. These attacks required many weeks of medical treatment. For the rest of her life, she continued to experience milder mood swings and severe headaches. On March 28, 1941, fearing yet another breakdown from which she might not recover, Woolf loaded her pockets with stones and drowned herself in the River Ouse near her Sussex home. </p><p>Recognized in her own time and country as one of the most significant of the Modernists, Woolf left sixteen volumes of fiction and essays, in addition to her diaries, letters, and memoirs. In the sixty years following her death, her novels and essays have reached an ever-increasing audience. She is now recognized as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Melymbrosia is her first completed novel. </p><p>Louise DeSalvo is professor of English and Creative Writing at Hunter College and the author of the highly-acclaimed Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work and Writing as a Way of Healing: How Telling Our Stories Transforms Our Lives, among other works. DeSalvo is also co-editor of The Letters of Vita Sackville-West to Virginia Woolf (Cleis, 2001).</p></p><h2>The Returning (A Seer Novel)</h2><p><b>They say the Awakening is coming.<br>That she&#x2019;s the key.</b><br><i>But can she find her identity in the light<br>Before she perishes in the dark?</i><br><br>Twenty years have passed since Carrington and Remko Brant&#x2019;s baby, Elise, was kidnapped and they were forced to leave her captive in the Authority City. Though they fled with the Seers far from Authority reach, they&#x2019;ve never given up hope of rescuing their daughter from the man who betrayed them. Now Authority President, he&#x2019;s ushered the city into a new era of &#x201c;peace&#x201d;&#x2015;one where the Scientist Roth Reynard&#x2019;s Genesis Serum has eradicated all memory of emotion or rebellion.<br><br>But the mysterious Aaron and his Seers are once again on the move, threatening the illusion the Authority has worked so hard to build. As the Seers send seven chosen warriors to rescue Elise and bring restoration to the Authority City, the lines are drawn for a final battle between light and darkness. The key to ultimate victory may rest within the strangely powerful girl who has felt forgotten but was never abandoned&#x2015;a truth she&#x2019;ll need to wage war against the powerful forces of evil.</p><p>The third and final book of Dekker&#x2019;s Seers series (after <i>The Calling</i>) begins nearly two decades after Elise Brant was kidnapped as her parents and other Seers (those who can sense their true calling) fled Authority City. After the Seers&#x2019; departure, Dr. Roth Reynard injected Authority residents with Genesis Serum, erasing memories and creating an unnatural, robotic state of peace. Immune to the serum, Elise has long posed a threat. She survives under the protection of Authority president Jesse Cropper, who struggles with Reynard&#x2019;s methods and madness. Meanwhile, the Seers, who have established a sanctuary in the mountains, have appointed a group of seven young people to return to Authority City in order to save those who have been deceived through the serum&#x2015;and to search for Elise. Fearing Elise&#x2019;s power, Reynard orders her death and sends security forces to round up and return the rebels to Authority City. Once the seven find Elise, it&#x2019;s a battle against time and resources to bring light to the delusional darkness fostered by Reynard. Dekker pens another striking science fiction thriller including a well-developed dystopian society and strong depictions of good versus evil that can be easily read as a standalone.

This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns. Visit our Web Page http://www.wiley.com/compbooks/</p><p><i>Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns</i> looks at how patterns occur on three different levels--in software architecture, in everyday design, and in idioms (which describe how a particular design pattern is implemented in a programming language like C++). This synthetic approach is a little theoretical at times, but the authors also present over a dozen patterns and provide real-world examples wherever possible.<p> For architectural patterns, the authors look at the Layers pattern, used in operating systems such as Windows NT and virtual machines. They also consider Pipes and Filters, which process streams of data. (This pattern, the authors point out, is a lynchpin of Unix.) Their Blackboard pattern shows how a complex problem, such as image or speech recognition can be broken up into smaller, specialized subsystems that work together to solve a problem. (For recognizing words from a raw waveform input, a Blackboard approach might have separate processes to find phonemes, then words, then sentences.)</p><p> This book also looks at today's distributed systems in considering the Broker pattern, which is used on the Internet and in Microsoft's OLE technology. This section also presents several powerful patterns for building effective graphical user interfaces, such as Model-View-Controller.</p><p> The authors define several well-known design patterns, such as the Proxy and Command patterns, and also basic, far-reaching patterns, such as Whole-Part and Master-Slave, which are widely used throughout computing. Their survey ends with a discussion on the way objects can communicate (using such patterns as Forwarder-Receiver, Client-Dispatcher-Server, and Publisher-Subscriber), which many developers will recognize as familiar patterns, but are codified here as "official" patterns. The book then discusses some idioms in C++ and a more far-reaching role for patterns in software design and architecture. By fitting patterns into traditional software engineering practices, the authors of <i>Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture</i> successfully argue that the role for patterns will only continue to diversify and enrich tomorrow's software engineering tools and methodologies. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p>This practical tutorial/reference demonstrates how patterns can enable users to create large-scale applications and solve recurring design problems. Contains a catalog of 25 patterns, described in a standardized format, that readers can use or adapt to their own development projects.</p><h2>Composition Practice 2</h2><p>This classic, step-by-step approach emphasizes the fundamentals of great composition writing.

And by 2050, they will have far surpassed us.<br> In this mind-bending new book, Hans Moravec takes the reader on a roller coaster ride packed with such startling predictions. He tells us, for instance, that in the not-too-distant future, an army of robots will displace workers, causing massive, unprecedented unemployment. But then, says Moravec, a period of very comfortable existence will follow, as humans benefit from a fully automated economy. And eventually, as machines evolve far beyond humanity, robots will supplant us. But if Moravec predicts the end of the domination by human beings, his is not a bleak vision. Far from railing against a future in which machines rule the world, Moravec embraces it, taking the startling view that intelligent robots will actually be our evolutionary heirs. "Intelligent machines, which will grow from us, learn our skills, and share our goals and values, can be viewed as children of our minds." And since they are our children, we will want them to outdistance us. In fact, in a bid for immortality, many of our descendants will choose to transform into "ex humans," as they upload themselves into advanced computers. We will become our children and live forever.<br> In his provocative new book, the highly anticipated follow-up to his bestselling volume <em>Mind Children</em>, Moravec charts the trajectory of robotics in breathtaking detail. A must read for artificial intelligence, technology, and computer enthusiasts, Moravec's freewheeling but informed speculations present a future far different than we ever dared imagine.<br></p><p>This is science fiction without the fiction--and more mind-bending than anything you ever saw on <i>Star Trek</i>. Moravec, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, envisions a not-too-distant future in which robots of superhuman intelligence have picked up the evolutionary baton from their human creators and headed out into space to colonize the universe.<p> This isn't anything that a million sci-fi paperbacks haven't already envisioned. The difference lies in Moravec's practical-minded mapping of the technological, economic, and social steps that could lead to that vision. Starting with the modest accomplishments of contemporary robotics research, he projects a likely course for the next 40 years of robot development, predicting the rise of superintelligent, creative, emotionally complex cyberbeings and the end of human labor by the middle of the next century.</p><p> After Moravec makes this point, his projections start to get really wild: robot corporations will take up residence in outer space with rogue cyborgs; planet-size robots will cruise the solar system looking for smaller bots to assimilate; and eventually every atom in the entire galaxy will be transformed into data-storage space, with a full-scale simulation of human civilization running as a subroutine somewhere.</p><p> His last chapter, which mingles the latest in avant-garde physics with hints of Borges's most intoxicating metaphysical conceits, is a breathtaking piece of hallucinatory eschatology. Moravec concludes by reminding us that even the wildest long-range predictions about the technological future never turn out to be as unhinged as they should have been. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p><br><strong>Hans Moravec</strong>, one of the leaders of robotics research, was a founder of the world's largest robotics program, at Carnegie Mellon University.

The book takes as its focus the nostalgic and violent Gisalo ceremony, one of the most remarkable performances in the anthropological literature. Tracking the major symbolic and emotional themes of the ceremony to their sources in everyday Kaluli life, Schieffelin shows how the central values and passions of Kaluli experience are governed by the basic forms of social reciprocity. However, Gisaro reveals that social reciprocity is not limited to the dynamics of transaction, obligation and alliance. It emerges, rather, as a mode of symbolic action and performative form, embodying a cultural scenario which shapes Kaluli emotional experience and moral sensibility and permeates their understanding of the human condition.</p><p>EDWARD SCHIEFFELIN is Reader Emeritus at University College London, UK. He received his BA in Physics and Philosophy from Yale University in 1960 and his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1972. He has spent more than five years among the Kaluli (Bosavi) people in Papua New Guinea since 1966.</p><h2>Beyond the Self: Conversations between Buddhism and Neuroscience (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Converging and diverging views on the mind, the self, consciousness, the unconscious, free will, perception, meditation, and other topics.</b></p><p>Buddhism shares with science the task of examining the mind empirically; it has pursued, for two millennia, direct investigation of the mind through penetrating introspection. Neuroscience, on the other hand, relies on third-person knowledge in the form of scientific observation. In this book, Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk trained as a molecular biologist, and Wolf Singer, a distinguished neuroscientist&#x2015;close friends, continuing an ongoing dialogue&#x2015;offer their perspectives on the mind, the self, consciousness, the unconscious, free will, epistemology, meditation, and neuroplasticity. </p><p>Ricard and Singer's wide-ranging conversation stages an enlightening and engaging encounter between Buddhism's wealth of experiential findings and neuroscience's abundance of experimental results. They discuss, among many other things, the difference between rumination and meditation (rumination is the scourge of meditation, but psychotherapy depends on it); the distinction between pure awareness and its contents; the Buddhist idea (or lack of one) of the unconscious and neuroscience's precise criteria for conscious and unconscious processes; and the commonalities between cognitive behavioral therapy and meditation. Their views diverge (Ricard asserts that the third-person approach will never encounter consciousness as a primary experience) and converge (Singer points out that the neuroscientific understanding of perception as reconstruction is very like the Buddhist <i>all-discriminating </i>wisdom) but both keep their vision trained on understanding fundamental aspects of human life.</p></p><p>Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk, trained as a molecular biologist before moving to Nepal to study Buddhism. He is the author of <i>The Monk and the Philosopher </i>(with his father, Jean-Fran�ois Revel);<i>The Quantum and the Lotus</i> (with Trinh Thuan); <i>Happiness</i>; <i>The Art of Meditation</i>; <i>Altruism: The Power of Compassion;</i><i>A Plea for the Animals</i>; and <i>Beyond the Self: Conversations between Buddhism and Neuroscience </i>(with Wolf Singer).<i>He has published several books of photography, including <i>Motionless Journey </i>and <i>Tibet: An Inner Journey</i>, and is the French interpreter for the Dalai Lama.</i><p>Matthieu Ricard's rare combination of a background in science and a lifetime of practicing Tibetan Buddhism makes him an ideal partner for this thoughtful conversation about the mind, meditation, free will, values, and the nature of consciousness with neuroscientist Wolf Singer.

(Cathy Alberda, MSc, RD <i>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada</i>)<br><br>[Review for previous edition:] Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract. Colitis is also inflammation but is inflammation of the large intestine. Both can be debilitating and very painful. One effective way of treatment is through diet. The authors, experts in gastrointestinal issues at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Canada, offer patients and families ways to cope with the dreaded disease in Crohn's and Colitis Diet Guide. Their explanation and diagrams are thorough and well researched. As well, the information is presented in lay terms so that anyone can understand it. The recipes include gentle ingredients as well as explanations why a specific ingredient is used. For example, the recipe for Turkey Apple Meatloaf calls for oat bran. The reason it is used is because oat bran's "gelling" properties help to form loose stool. Because of this desirable effect, many low-residue diets include oats and oat<br> products despite the increased fiber content. Each recipe also comes with a nutrient table covering calories, fat, fiber, protein and carbohydrates. I believe that Crohn's and Colitis Diet Guide would be well worth having by anyone that is stricken with these diseases or for anyone that has to cook for a victim. The recipes are simple and the ingredients could be found in any pantry or local grocery store. But, more so the authors' information is an added resource for those already with some knowledge.

By excluding biophysical and social systems from their analyses, many conventional economists overlook problems of the increasing scale of human impacts and the inequitable distribution of resources. Ecological Economics is an introductory-level textbook for an emerging paradigm that addresses this flaw in much economic thought. The book defines a revolutionary "transdiscipline" that incorporates insights from the biological, physical, and social sciences, and it offers a pedagogically complete examination of this exciting new field. The book provides students with a foundation in traditional neoclassical economic thought, but places that foundation within a new interdisciplinary framework that embraces the linkages among economic growth, environmental degradation, and social inequity. Introducing the three core issues that are the focus of the new transdiscipline -- scale, distribution, and efficiency -- the book is guided by the fundamental question, often assumed but rarely spoken in traditional texts: What is really important to us? After explaining the key roles played by the earth's biotic and abiotic resources in sustaining life, the text is then organized around the main fields in traditional economics: microeconomics, macroeconomics, and international economics. The book also takes an additional step of considering the policy implications of this line of thinking.<i>Ecological Economics</i> includes numerous features that make it accessible to a wide range of students: more than thirty text boxes that highlight issues of special importance to students lists of key terms that help students organize the main points in each chapter concise definitions of new terms that are highlighted in the text for easy reference study questions that encourage student exploration beyond the text glossary and list of further readingsAn accompanying workbook presents an innovative, applied problem-based learning approach to teaching economics.While many books have been written on ecological economics, and several textbooks describe basic concepts of the field, this is the only stand-alone textbook that offers a complete explanation of both theory and practice. It will serve an important role in educating a new generation of economists and is an invaluable new text for undergraduate and graduate courses in ecological economics, environmental economics, development economics, human ecology, environmental studies, sustainability science, and community development.</p><p>Herman E.

First date, second date, a restaurant here, a movie there, always just matinees. You start sleeping together, the sex is mind-blowing, and pretty soon there&#x2019;s feeling too. And then, one day, she shows up in tears, and you hug her and tell her to take it easy, everything&#x2019;s going to be OK, and she says she can&#x2019;t stand it anymore, she has this secret, not just a secret, something really awful, a curse, something she&#x2019;s been wanting to tell you from the beginning but she didn&#x2019;t have the guts. This thing, it&#x2019;s been weighing her down, and now she&#x2019;s got to tell you, she&#x2019;s simply got to, but she knows that as soon as she does, you&#x2019;ll leave her, and you&#x2019;ll be absolutely right to leave her, too. And then she starts crying all over again.</p><p>I won&#x2019;t leave you, you tell her. I won&#x2019;t. I love you. You try to look concerned, but you&#x2019;re not. Not really. Or rather, if you are concerned, it&#x2019;s about her crying, not about her secret. You know by now that these secrets that always make a woman fall to pieces are usually something along the lines of doing it with an animal, or a Mormon, or with someone who paid her for it. I&#x2019;m a whore, they always wind up saying. And you hug them and say, no you&#x2019;re not. You&#x2019;re not. And if they don&#x2019;t stop crying all you can do is say shhh. It&#x2019;s something really terrible, she insists, as if she&#x2019;s picked up on how nonchalant you are about it, even though you&#x2019;ve tried to hide it. In the pit of your stomach it may sound terrible, you tell her, but that&#x2019;s just acoustics. As soon as you let it out it won&#x2019;t seem anywhere near as bad&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll see. And she almost believes you. She hesitates and then she asks: What if I told you that at night I turn into a heavy, hairy man, with no neck, with a gold ring on his pinkie, would you still love me? And you tell her of course you would. What else can you say? That you wouldn&#x2019;t? She&#x2019;s just trying to test you, to see whether you love her unconditionally&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ve always been a winner at tests. In fact, as soon as you say it, she melts, and you do it, right there in the living room. And afterward, you lie there holding each other tight, and she cries because she&#x2019;s so relieved, and you cry too. Go figure. And unlike all the other times, she doesn&#x2019;t get up and go. She stays there and falls asleep. And you lie awake, looking at her beautiful body, at the sunset outside, at the moon appearing as if out of nowhere, at the silvery light flickering over her body, stroking the hair on her back. And within five minutes you find yourself lying next to this guy&#x2014;this short fat guy. And the guy gets up and smiles at you, and awkwardly gets dressed. He leaves the room and you follow him, spellbound. He&#x2019;s in the den now, his thick fingers fiddling with the remote, zapping to the sports channels. Championship soccer. When they miss a pass, he curses the TV; when they score, he gets up and does a little victory dance.</p><p>After the game he tells you that his throat is dry and his stomach is growling. He could really use a beer and a big steak. Welldone if possible, and with lots of onion rings, but he&#x2019;d settle for pork chops. So you get in the car and take him to this restaurant that he knows about. This new twist has you worried, it really does, but you have no idea what you should do. Your command-and-control centers are down. You shift gears at the exit, in a daze. He&#x2019;s right there beside you in the passenger seat, tapping that gold-ringed pinkie of his. At the next intersection, he rolls down his window, winks at you, and yells at a girl who&#x2019;s trying to thumb a ride: Hey, baby, wanna play nanny goat and ride in the back? Later, the two of you pack in the steak and the chops and the onion rings till you&#x2019;re about to explode, and he enjoys every bite, and laughs like a baby. And all that time you keep telling yourself it&#x2019;s got to be a dream. A bizarre dream, yes, but definitely one that you&#x2019;ll snap out of any minute.</p><p>On the way back, you ask him where he&#x2019;d like you to drop him off, and he pretends not to hear you, but he looks despondent. So you wind up taking him home. It&#x2019;s almost three a.m. I&#x2019;m hitting the sack, you tell him, and he waves his hand, and stays in the beanbag chair, staring at the fashion channel. You wake up the next morning, exhausted, and your stomach hurts. And there she is, in the living room, still dozing. But by the time you&#x2019;ve had your shower, she&#x2019;s up. She gives you a sheepish hug, and you&#x2019;re too embarrassed to say anything. Time goes by and you&#x2019;re still together. The sex just gets better and better. She&#x2019;s not so young anymore, and neither are you, and suddenly you find yourselves talking about a baby. And at night, you and fatso hit the town like you&#x2019;ve never done in your life. He takes you to restaurants and bars you didn&#x2019;t even know existed, and you dance on the tables together, and break plates like there&#x2019;s no tomorrow. He&#x2019;s really nice, the fatso, a little crass, especially with women; sometimes the things he comes out with make you want to sink into the floor. Other than that, he&#x2019;s lots of fun. When you first met him, you didn&#x2019;t give a damn about soccer, but now you know every team. And whenever one of your favorites wins, you feel like you&#x2019;ve made a wish and it&#x2019;s come true. Which is a pretty exceptional feeling for someone like you, who hardly knows what he wants most of the time. And so it goes: every night you fall asleep with him struggling to stay awake for the Argentinean finals, and in the morning there she is, the beautiful, forgiving woman who you love, too, till it hurts.</p><p>THE NIMROD FLIPOUT Copyright � 2002, 2006 by Etgar Keret</p></p><h2>A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake: Unlocking James Joyce&#39;s Masterwork</h2><p>Since its publication in 1939, countless would-be readers of Finnegans Wake &#x2014; James Joyce's masterwork that consumed a third of his life &#x2014; have given up after a few pages and dismissed it as a "perverse triumph of the unintelligible." In 1944, a young professor of mythology and literature named Joseph Campbell, working with Henry Morton Robinson, wrote the first "key" or guide to entering the fascinating, disturbing, marvelously rich world of Finnegans Wake. The authors break down Joyce's "unintelligible" book page by page, stripping the text of much of its obscurity and serving up thoughtful interpretations via footnotes and bracketed commentary. A Skeleton Key was Campbell's first book, published five years before he wrote his breakthrough Hero with a Thousand Faces.</p><p>Perhaps most responsible for bringing mythology to a mass audience, Joseph Campbell&#x2019;s works rank among the classics in mythology and literature: Hero with a Thousand Faces, the four-volume The Masks of God, The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers, and many others. Among his many awards, Campbell received the National Institute of Arts and Letters Award for Contribution to Creative Literature and the 1985 Medal of Honor for Literature from the National Arts Club. A past president of the American Society for the Study of Religion, Campbell was professor emeritus at Sarah Lawrence College in New York until his death in 1987.Campbell and Robinson deserve a citation from the Republic of Letters for having succeeded in bringing out their Skeleton Key at this time....The chance to be among the first to explore the wonders of <i>Finnegans Wake</i> is one of the few great intellectual and aesthetic treats that these last bad years have yielded.&#x201d;<br> <b>Edmund Wilson</b>, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> Joyce has found in Mr. Campbell and Mr. Robinson the ideal readers who approach his book with piety, passion, and intelligence, and who have devoted several years to fashioning the key that will open its treasures.&#x201d;<br> <b>Max Lerner</b>, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br><br>"The key that will open [<i>Finnegans Wake's</i>] treasures." <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Kidpreneurs: Young Entrepreneurs With Big Ideas!</h2><p>You&#39;ve heard the saying, It&#39;s never too late.

What an empowering book for our children to read! by: Wild About Reading --Amazon.com review<br><br>I just want to thank these brothers for writing this. I often wonder what my daughter thinks when daddy heads to the basement office to do his business thing. This book was written by a couple of guys that obviously understand entrepreneurship and kids. It's written wonderfully and surprisingly loaded with information. I actually didn't expect it to be so comprehensive. It even has a little business planner in it. I've no doubt we should all be teaching our kids about entrepreneurship because the world JUST ISN'T for nine to fivers anymore. The career world has changed almost overnight. Thanks guys for taking the time because as you already know books are often more a labor of love than a profit source. So, thanks for sharing both your minds and your hearts!

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, <br>Of unimprov�d mettle hot and full, <br>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there <br>Sharked up a list of landless resolutes <br>For food and diet to some enterprise <br>That hath a stomach in't, which is no other - <br>And it doth well appear unto our state - <br>But to recover of us, by strong hand <br>And terms compulsative, those foresaid lands <br>So by his father lost: and this, I take it, <br>Is the main motive of our preparations, <br>The source of this our watch and the chief head <br>Of this post-haste and rummage in the land. <br> <br> <i>Enter Ghost again</i> <br> <br>But soft, behold!

They attempt to strike it <br> <br>BARNARDO 'Tis here! <br> <br>HORATIO 'Tis here! <br> <br>MARCELLUS 'Tis gone! <i>Exit Ghost</i> <br>We do it wrong, being so majestical, <br>To offer it the show of violence, <br>For it is as the air invulnerable, <br>And our vain blows malicious mockery. <br> <br>BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew. <br> <br>HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing <br>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard <br>The cock, that is the trumpet to the day, <br>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat <br>Awake the god of day, and at his warning, <br>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, <br>Th'extravagant and erring spirit hies <br>To his confine: and of the truth herein <br>This present object made probation. <br> <br>MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock. <br>Some say that ever gainst that season comes <br>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, <br>The bird of dawning singeth all night long, <br>And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad: <br>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, <br>No fairy talks, nor witch hath power to charm, <br>So hallowed and so gracious is the time. <br> <br>HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it. <br>But, look, the morn in russet mantle clad, <br>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill. <br>Break we our watch up, and by my advice, <br>Let us impart what we have seen tonight <br>Unto young Hamlet, for upon my life, <br>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. <br>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, <br>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? <br> <br>MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray, and I this morning know <br>Where we shall find him most conveniently. <i>Exeunt</i> <br> <br> <b><br>Act 1 Scene 2</b> <i>running scene 2</i> <br> <i><br>Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,<br>Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant</i> <br> <br>KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death <br>The memory be green, and that it us befitted <br>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom <br>To be contracted in one brow of woe, <br>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature <br>That we with wisest sorrow think on him <br>Together with remembrance of ourselves. <br>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, <br>Th'imperial jointress of this warlike state, <br>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, <br>With one auspicious and one dropping eye, <br>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, <br>In equal scale weighing delight and dole, <br>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barred <br>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone <br>With this affair along. For all, our thanks. <br>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras, <br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth, <br>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death <br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, <br>Colleagu�d with the dream of his advantage, <br>He hath not failed to pester us with message <br>Importing the surrender of those lands <br>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, <br>To our most valiant brother. So much for him. <br> <br> <i>Enter Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting, <br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ <br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras - <br>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears <br>Of this his nephew's purpose - to suppress <br>His further gait herein, in that the levies, <br>The lists and full proportions, are all made <br>Out of his subject. And we here dispatch <br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, <br>For bearing of this greeting to old Norway, <br>Giving to you no further personal power <br>To business with the king, more than the scope <br>Of these dilated articles allow. <i>[Gives a paper]</i> <br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. <br> <br>VOLTEMAND In that, and all things, will we show our duty. <br> <br>KING We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.- <br> <br> <i>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius</i> <br> <br>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? <br>You told us of some suit: what is't, Laertes? <br>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane <br>And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, <br>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? <br>The head is not more native to the heart, <br>The hand more instrumental to the mouth, <br>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. <br>What wouldst thou have, Laertes? <br> <br>LAERTES Dread my lord, <br>Your leave and favour to return to France, <br>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark <br>To show my duty in your coronation, <br>Yet now I must confess, that duty done, <br>My thoughts and wishes bend again towards France <br>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. <br> <br>KING Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? <br> <br>POLONIUS He hath, my lord: <br>I do beseech you, give him leave to go. <br> <br>KING Take thy fair hour, Laertes: time be thine, <br>And thy best graces spend it at thy will.- <br>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son- <br> <br>HAMLET A little more than kin and less than kind. <br> <br>KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you? <br> <br>HAMLET Not so, my lord:- I am too much i'th'sun. [ <i>Aside?</i>] <br> <br>GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nightly colour off, <br>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. <br>Do not forever with thy veil�d lids <br>Seek for thy noble father in the dust: <br>Thou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die, <br>Passing through nature to eternity. <br> <br>HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common. <br> <br>GERTRUDE If it be, <br>Why seems it so particular with thee? <br> <br>HAMLET 'Seems', madam? Nay it is: I know not 'seems'. <br>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, <br>Nor customary suits of solemn black, <br>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, <br>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, <br>Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage, <br>Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief, <br>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, <br>For they are actions that a man might play, <br>But I have that within which passeth show; <br>These but the trappings and the suits of woe. <br>KING 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, <br>To give these mourning duties to your father: <br>But you must know your father lost a father, <br>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound <br>In filial obligation for some term <br>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever <br>In obstinate condolement is a course <br>Of impious stubbornness: 'tis unmanly grief: <br>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, <br>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, <br>An understanding simple and unschooled. <br>For what we know must be and is as common <br>As any the most vulgar thing to sense, <br>Why should we in our peevish opposition <br>Take it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven, <br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, <br>To reason most absurd, whose common theme <br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, <br>From the first corpse till he that died today, <br>'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth <br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us <br>As of a father; for let the world take note, <br>You are the most immediate to our throne, <br>And with no less nobility of love <br>Than that which dearest father bears his son, <br>Do I impart towards you. For your intent <br>In going back to school in Wittenberg, <br>It is most retrograde to our desire, <br>And we beseech you bend you to remain <br>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, <br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. <br> <br>GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: <br>I prithee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. <br> <br>HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you, madam. <br> <br>KING Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. <br>Be as ourself in Denmark.- Madam, come: <br>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet <br>Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof, <br>No jocund health that Denmark drinks today <br>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, <br>And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again, <br>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. <br> <br> <i>Exeunt.

Is it revolutionary? Or is it reactionary? This book argues that it is both: fascism unleashes violence against the left and ethnic minorities, but also condemns the bourgeoisie for its &#34;softness&#34;. Kevin Passmore opens his book with a series of &#34;scenes from fascist life&#34;--a secret meeting of the Romanian Iron Guard; Mussolini meeting the king of Italy; a rally of Hungarian doctors calling for restrictions on the number of Jews entering the profession. He then looks at the paradoxes of fascism through its origins in the political and social crisis of the late nineteenth century, the history of fascist movements and regimes in Italy and Germany, and the fortunes of &#34;failed&#34; fascist movements in Romania, Hungary and Spain. He shows how fascism employs propaganda and popular culture to propagate itself and how it exported its ideas outside Europe, through Nazi and Spanish post-war escape routes to Latin America. The book concludes with a discussion of the recent revival of the extreme right in Austria, Italy, France, and Russia.</p><p><br><strong>Kevin Passmore</strong> is Lecturer in History at the University of Wales, Cardiff. His books include <em>From Liberalism to Fascism: The Right in a French Province</em>, <em>Writing National Histories: Western Europe Since 1800</em>, <em>The French Right: A History</em>, and <em>Women, Gender and the Extreme Right in Europe, 1919-1945</em>.<br>`'Kevin Passmore's excellent introduction to the subject succeeds on many levels [...] There are few books by a single author that deal with fascism as a generic phenomenon across the whole of Europe, especially one as concise as this, and as refreshingly free of jargon and the inevitable,<br>interminable, typologies''<br>Tim Kirk, Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought</h2><p>This ground-breaking text explores the intersection between dominant modes of critical educational theory and the socio-political landscape of American Indian education. Grande asserts that, with few exceptions, the matters of Indigenous people and Indian education have been either largely ignored or indiscriminately absorbed within critical theories of education. Furthermore, American Indian scholars and educators have largely resisted engagement with critical educational theory, tending to concentrate instead on the production of historical monographs, ethnographic studies, tribally-centered curricula, and site-based research. Such a focus stems from the fact that most American Indian scholars feel compelled to address the socio-economic urgencies of their own communities, against which engagement in abstract theory appears to be a luxury of the academic elite. While the author acknowledges the dire need for practical-community based research, she maintains that the global encroachment on Indigenous lands, resources, cultures and communities points to the equally urgent need to develop transcendent theories of decolonization and to build broad-based coalitions.</p><p><b>Sandy Grande</b> is associate professor of education at Connecticut College.Sandy Grande's book is an important contribution to the scholarship on Native American education and it contains a critical analysis and guide to current thinking. It also offers a powerful agenda for charting the future course of Native American education. (Joel Spring)<br><br>Sandy Grande ably succeeds in defining the common ground between American Indian intellectuals and critical scholars engaged in anti-imperialist and anticapitalist struggles for decolonization, an unintended but plausible and relatively absent anticolonial indigenous contribution to critical adult education. (<i>Adult Education Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Although critical of dominant modes, Grande nevertheless maintains that scholars should not reject all of them, but instead maintain a critical stance, a key component of <i>Red Pedagoogy</i>. This book is necessary reading for anyone seeking 'emancipatory pedagogies' for indigenous people. (Steven Crum)<br><br><i>Red Pedagogy</i> is sure to become a classic text in the field of critical education. Grande's book represents arguably the most significant advancement within the critical pedagogical literature in recent decades. It is a book that cannot be ignored. This book will define the central terms of the educational debate over social justice for years to come. It is a landmark work by one of education's most important new scholars and activists.

Fear has become the world we live in.</p><p>The administration of fear also means that states are tempted to create policies for the orchestration and management of fear. Globalization has progressively eaten away at the traditional prerogatives of states (most notably of the welfare state), and states have to convince citizens that they can ensure their physical safety. </p><p>In this new and lengthy interview, Paul Virilio shows us how the &#x201c;propaganda of progress,&#x201d; the illuminism of new technologies, provide unexpected vectors for fear in the way that they manufacture frenzy and stupor. For Virilio, the economic catastrophe of 2007 was not the death knell of capitalism, as some have claimed, but just further evidence that capitalism has accelerated into turbo-capitalism, and is accelerating still. With every natural disaster, health scare, and malicious rumor now comes the inevitable &#x201c;information bomb&#x201d;&#x2015;live feeds take over real space, and technology connects life to the immediacy of terror, the ultimate expression of speed.

It was first published anonymously on January 9, 1776, during the American Revolution. Paine wrote it with editorial feedback from Benjamin Rush, who came up with the title. The document denounced British rule and, through its immense popularity, contributed to fomenting the American Revolution... Paine donated the copyright for Common Sense to the states, and as one biographer noted, Paine made nothing of the estimated 150,000 to 600,000 copies that were eventually printed (various sources disagree on the number of printed copies in Paine's lifetime). In fact, he had to pay for the first printing himself." (Source: wikipedia.org)<br><br>"Rights of Man was written by Thomas Paine in 1791 as a reply to Reflections on the Revolution in France by Edmund Burke. It has been interpreted as a work defending the French Revolution, but it is also a seminal work embodying the ideas of liberty and human equality." (Source: wikipedia.org)<br><br>"The Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology... critiques institutionalized religion and challenges the inerrancy of the Bible. Published in three parts in 1794, 1795 and 1807, it was a bestseller in America, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French revolution, received it with more hostility." (Source: wikipedia.org)<br><br>Essay on Dream was first published in 1807. Mr. Paine attempts to show by what operation of the mind a Dream is produced in sleep, and applying the same to the account of Dreams in the New Testament.<br><br>Biblical Blasphemy is a short work summarizing Mr. Paine's Deistic beliefs.<br><br>Examination of the Prophecies was first published by Mr. Paine in 1807, and was the last of his writings edited by himself. It is evidently extracted from his answer to the bishop of Llandaff, or from his third part of the Age of Reason, both of which, it appears by his will, he left in manuscript.<br><br><b>Table of Contents:</b> <br><br>Publisher&#x2019;s Preface; Common Sense; Introduction; Of The Origin And Design Of Government In General, With Concise Remarks On The English Constitution; Of Monarchy And Hereditary Succession; Thoughts On The Present State Of American Affairs; Of The Present Ability Of America, With Some Miscellaneous Reflexions; Appendix; Rights Of Man; Part I.; Editor's Introduction.; Paine's Preface To The English Edition; Paine's Preface To The French Edition; Rights Of Man; Miscellaneous Chapter; Conclusion; Part ii.

Born in Great Britain, he lived in America, having migrated to the American colonies just in time to take part in the American Revolution, mainly as the author of the powerful, widely read pamphlet, Common Sense (1776), advocating independence for the American Colonies from the Kingdom of Great Britain and of The American Crisis, supporting the Revolution.<br><br>Later, Paine was a great influence on the French Revolution. He wrote the Rights of Man (1791) as a guide to the ideas of the Enlightenment. Despite an inability to speak French, he was elected to the French National Assembly in 1792. Regarded as an ally of the Girondists, he was seen with increasing disfavour by the Montagnards and in particular by Robespierre.<br><br>Paine was arrested in Paris and imprisoned in December 1793; he was released in 1794. He became notorious with his book, The Age of Reason (1793-94), which advocated deism and took issue with Christian doctrines. While in France, he also wrote a pamphlet titled Agrarian Justice (1795), which discussed the origins of property and introduced a concept that is similar to a guaranteed minimum income.<br><br>Paine remained in France during the early Napoleonic Era, but condemned Napoleon's moves towards dictatorship, calling him "the completest charlatan that ever existed."[1] Paine remained in France until 1802, when he returned to America on an invitation from Thomas Jefferson, who had been elected president.<br><br>Paine died at 59 Grove Street in Greenwich Village, New York City, on the morning of June 8, 1809." <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i></p><h2>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)</h2><p>Sumptuously illustrated in color and packed with information, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece is now available for the first time in paperback. Offering fresh interpretations of classical Greek culture, the book devotes as much attention to social, economic and intellectual aspects as to politics and war. Paul Cartledge and his team of contributors ask what it was like for an ordinary person to partake in &#34;the glory that was Greece.&#34; They examine the influences of the environment and economy; the experience of workers, soldiers, slaves, peasants and women; and the roles of myth and religion, art and culture, and science and education. This is a cultural history from the bottom up, which lays bare the far-reaching linguistic, literary, artistic and political legacy of ancient Greece, and seeks justification for Shelley&#39;s claim that &#34;we are all Greeks.&#34; Paul Cartledge is Professor in Greek History in the Faculty of Classics at the University of Cambridge and is Fellow and Director of Studies in Classics at Clare College, Cambridge. He is the author of several books about ancient Greece, including Spartan Reflections (California, 2001), Hellenistic and Roman Sparta (Routledge, 2001) and Sparta and Lakonia (Routledge, 2002).</p><p>Sumptuously illustrated, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece offers fresh, novel interpretations of classical Greek culture SH devoting as much attention to the social, economic and intellectual aspects as to politics and war.

There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter "Economic Reality" has also been revised to reflect a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems.</p></p><p>As the Earth has made more than 5,000 rotations since The Sciences of the Artificial was last revised, in 1981, it is time to ask what changes in our understanding of the world call for changes in the text.Herbert A.

The "Nowhere" of <b>News from Nowhere</b> (1890) is England in 2102, an ideal pastoral society born out of revolution. It is as compelling a dream of the future as the nightmares of <b>Brave New World</b> and <b>Nineteen Eighty-Four</b>. Exhilaratingly, it reminds us that nothing is inevitable about the way we live&#x2014;now or in 1890.</p><p>William Morris was a dreamer with a genius for turning dreams into reality. Self-taught in thirteen different crafts, some of them ancient ones that had died out, he became the greatest European pattern-designer since the Middle Ages. He was, besides, a campaigning socialist and a pioneering environmentalist, a lyric poet and a forceful journalist, a storyteller and a maker of fine books.</p><h2>Special Education for Today&#39;s Teachers: An Introduction</h2><p><p>Are you prepared to serve and teach all students?

Structured according to the seasonal units of an ancient Chinese almanac, <i>East Wind Melts the Ice</i> is made up of 72 short chapters that can be read straight through or dipped into at random. In the essays, Dalby transports us from her Berkeley garden to the streets of Kyoto, to Imperial China, to the sea cliffs of Northern California, and to points beyond. Throughout these journeys, Dalby weaves her memories of living in Japan and becoming the first and only non-Japanese geisha, her observations on the recurring phenomena of the natural world, and meditations on the cultural aesthetics of Japan, China, and California. She illuminates everyday life as well, in stories of keeping a pet butterfly, roasting rice cakes with her children, watching whales, and pampering worms to make compost. In the manner of the Japanese personal poetic essay, this vibrant work comprises 72 windows on a life lived between cultures, and the result is a wonderfully engaging read.</p><p>"To read <i>East Wind Melts the Ice</i> is to slip into a time stream that is both as long and sinuous as history and as ephemeral as the present moment. Drawing inspiration from the thousand year old history of Japanese poetic diaries, and form from the ancient Chinese almanac that she uses to contain her musings, Liza Dalby has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of translating the sensibility of the Heian Court of 11th century Japan into the context of contemporary America. The result is a stunning chronicle of the beauty of time passing and an evocation of the transient and whimsical nature of all things."&#x2014;Ruth Ozeki, author of <i>My Year of Meats</i> and <i>All Over Creation</i><br><br>"I imagine Liza Dalby writing this book in an ancient library, a lion sleeping at her side, as in the paintings of Saint Jerome. As she collects and layers arcane and fascinating pieces of knowledge, she builds her own very personal almanac packed with the wonder of loving two cultures, the intense inner life of each season, and boundless curiosity of the scholar/child. This is a book to dip in and out of throughout the year."&#x2014;Frances Mayes, author of <i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i><br><br>"Liza Dalby's memoir of the seasons is as fresh and captivating as springtime. A very special book."&#x2014;Michael Pollan, author of <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i><br><br>"This beautiful book awakens the senses. A journal, an almanac of the seasons, and a series of reflections on ancient Eastern Chinese and Japanese cultures, here you will find subtle observations of rain and heat, tangerines, mulberries and paulownia trees, crickets and doves forming a rich tapestry as they are woven with evocative fragments of history&#x2014;stories of geishas, of salesmen who sold bulk fireflies, of the wood that was used for kimono chests, of emptiness in the tea ceremony. Like a lush garden, this book is meant to savor."&#x2014;Susan Griffin, author of <i>The Book of the Courtesans</i><b>Liza Dalby</b> is an anthropologist specializing in Japanese culture.

From the conquest of Mexico by smallpox as much as by the Spanish, to the bubonic plague in China, to the typhoid epidemic in Europe, the history of disease is the history of humankind. With the identification of AIDS in the early 1980s, another chapter has been added to this chronicle of events, which William McNeill explores in his new introduction to this updated editon.<br><br>Thought-provoking, well-researched, and compulsively readable, <i>Plagues and Peoples</i> is that rare book that is as fascinating as it is scholarly, as intriguing as it is enlightening. "A brilliantly conceptualized and challenging achievement" (Kirkus Reviews), it is essential reading, offering a new perspective on human history.</p><p>No small themes for historian William McNeill: he is a writer of big, sweeping books, from <b>The Rise of the West</b> to <b>The History of the World</b>. <b>Plagues and Peoples</b> considers the influence of infectious diseases on the course of history, and McNeill pays special attention to the Black Death of the 13th and 14th centuries, which killed millions across Europe and Asia. (At one point, writes McNeill, 10,000 people in Constantinople alone were dying each day from the plague.) With the new crop of plagues and epidemics in our own time, McNeill's quiet assertion that "in any effort to understand what lies ahead the role of infectious disease cannot properly be left out of consideration" takes on new significance.McNeill's highly acclaimed work is a brilliant and challenging account of the effects of disease on human history. His sophisticated analysis and detailed grasp of the subject make this book fascinating reading. By the author of <i>The Rise Of The West</i>.</p><h2>Local Histories/Global Designs</h2><p><p>This book is an extended argument on the "coloniality" of power by one of the most innovative scholars of Latin American studies. In a shrinking world where sharp dichotomies, such as East/West and developing/developed, blur and shift, Walter Mignolo points to the inadequacy of current practice in the social sciences and area studies. He introduces the crucial notion of "colonial difference" into study of the modern colonial world. He also traces the emergence of new forms of knowledge, which he calls "border thinking."</p><p>Further, he expands the horizons of those debates already under way in postcolonial studies of Asia and Africa by dwelling in the genealogy of thoughts of South/Central America, the Caribbean, and Latino/as in the United States. His concept of "border gnosis," or what is known from the perspective of an empire's borderlands, counters the tendency of occidentalist perspectives to dominate, and thus limit, understanding.</p><p>The book is divided into three parts: the first chapter deals with epistemology and postcoloniality; the next three chapters deal with the geopolitics of knowledge; the last three deal with the languages and cultures of scholarship. Here the author reintroduces the analysis of civilization from the perspective of globalization and argues that, rather than one "civilizing" process dominated by the West, the continually emerging subaltern voices break down the dichotomies characteristic of any cultural imperialism. By underscoring the fractures between globalization and <i>mundializacion</i>, Mignolo shows the locations of emerging border epistemologies, and of post-occidental reason.</p><p>In a new preface that discusses <i>Local Histories/Global Designs</i> as a dialogue with Hegel's <i>Philosophy of History</i>, Mignolo connects his argument with the unfolding of history in the first decade of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><br><p>"Walter Mignolo, one of America's most eminent postcolonialists, presents a challenging new paradigm for understanding the realities of a planetary 'coloniality of power,' and the limits of area studies in the United States. Local History/Global Designs is one of the most important books in the historical humanities to have emerged since the end of the Cold War University.

Foreign intelligence services, particularly those of China, Russia, and Cuba, are recruiting spies in our midst and stealing our secrets and cutting-edge technologies. In <i>To Catch a Spy: The Art of Counterintelligence</i>, James M. Olson, former chief of CIA counterintelligence, offers a wake-up call for the American public and also a guide for how our country can do a better job of protecting its national security and trade secrets. Olson takes the reader into the arcane world of counterintelligence as he lived it during his thirty-year career in the CIA. After an overview of what the Chinese, Russian, and Cuban spy services are doing to the United States, Olson explains the nitty-gritty of the principles and methods of counterintelligence. Readers will learn about specific aspects of counterintelligence such as running double-agent operations and surveillance. The book also analyzes twelve actual case studies to illustrate why people spy against their country, the tradecraft of counterintelligence, and where counterintelligence breaks down or succeeds.

A key figure in the New York art scene, he inventively explored the interplay between words and images throughout his career, first as a member of SAMO, a graffiti group active on the Lower East Side in the late 1970s, and then as a painter acclaimed for his unmistakable Neoexpressionist style. From 1980 to 1987, he filled numerous working notebooks with drawings and handwritten texts. This facsimile edition reproduces the pages of eight of these fascinating and rarely seen notebooks for the first time.</p><br><p>The notebooks are filled with images and words that recur in Basquiat's paintings and other works. Iconic drawings and pictograms of crowns, teepees, and hatch-marked hearts share space with handwritten texts, including notes, observations, and poems that often touch on culture, race, class, and life in New York. Like his other work, the notebooks vividly demonstrate Basquiat&#x2019;s deep interests in comic, street, and pop art, hip-hop, politics, and the ephemera of urban life. They also provide an intimate look at the working process of one of the most creative forces in contemporary American art.</p></p><p><p>"Jean-Michel Basquiat's journals are, by turns, cryptic, revelatory, beautiful, and unsettling.

Their leader is relentless in his efforts to turn his ragtag band of men and boys into a disciplined force that accomplishes its goals without losing its moral compass. And so when they're not raiding peasants' homes for food and supplies, or training with the weapons taken from the soldiers they have ambushed and killed, the partisans read books of faith and philosophy that they have rescued from abandoned Jewish homes, and they draw strength from the women, the elderly, and the remarkably resilient orphaned children they are protecting. When they hear about the advances being made by the Soviet Army, the partisans prepare for what they know will be a furious attack on their compound by the retreating Germans. In the heartbreaking aftermath, the survivors emerge from the forest to bury their dead, care for their wounded, and grimly confront a world that is surprised by their existence--and profoundly unwelcoming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narrated by seventeen-year-old Edmund--a member of the group who maintains his own inner resolve with memories of his parents and their life before the war--this powerful story of Jews who fought back is suffused with the riveting detail that Aharon Appelfeld was uniquely able to bring to his award-winning novels.</p><p><b>AHARON APPELFELD</b> is the author of more than forty works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Iron Tracks, Until the Dawn's Light </i>(both winners of the National Jewish Book Award), <i>The Story of a Life</i> (winner of the Prix M�dicis �tranger), and <i>Badenheim 1939</i>.

Is this medication really going to improve my son&#x2019;s symptoms? How best can I help my patient and her parents manage this difficult disorder? Will the side effects of this drug outweigh the benefits? What are my other options?<br><br> Because ADHD affects every facet of life, from psychosocial development and peer relationships to family dynamics and academic and job performance, the need for better&#x2015;that is, safer and more effective&#x2015;treatments is urgent. Here, seasoned clinicians Pat Gerbarg and Richard Brown, known for providing the latest breakthroughs in integrative mental health treatments, draw on over 30 years&#x2019; clinical experience to offer a range of scientifically-grounded complementary and alternative treatments for parents and professionals alike.<br><br> Studies show that children with untreated ADHD are at greater risk for substance abuse, unemployment, accidents, and criminal behavior, in addition to learning disabilities, anxiety disorders, social phobia, depression, and bipolar disorder. And yet, individuals with ADHD often bring a great deal of energy, enthusiasm, and creativity to the tasks they undertake. Gerbarg and Brown focus on these intrinsic strengths, encouraging parents and professionals to help children with ADHD fulfill their potential by overcoming distraction, restlessness, and impulsivity in order to focus on learning, task completion, and understanding social cues. To accomplish this, they argue, we need to implement a variety of alternative approaches.<br><br> Drawing on stories and anecdotes from their own clinical practice, Gerbarg and Brown address the questions that are particularly important to those dealing with ADHD. Early chapters provide information about diagnostic issues and the scientific foundation for understanding the known causes of ADHD, as well as how different treatments may work and why. Multiple contributing causes of ADHD exist&#x2015;genetic, nutritional, chemical, psychological, trauma-based, and environmental&#x2015;and the authors explain how treatments need to be strategically combined and tailored to patients&#x2019; unique needs and sensitivities.<br><br> Later chapters present integrative strategies that combine the best practices of psychological treatments with herbs, nutrients, cognitive enhancers, mind&#x2013;body practices, and brain stimulation.<br> Throughout, the authors draw on the work and methods of many talented clinicians, yoga therapists, and teachers who have found creative, effective approaches to helping their own clients who struggle with attentional problems.<br><br> A comprehensive resources section at the end of the book features a compilation of need-to-know websites, journals, books, and supplement brands with dosing recommendations. Psychiatrists, psychologists, and other therapists are equipped with access to the very latest research in both conventional and complementary and alternative approaches.<br><br> With this book, the authors of <em>How to Use Herbs, Nutrients &amp; Yoga in Mental Health</em> have taken their extraordinary scholarly and healing talents to a new level, helping parents and therapists alike to better understand and manage a complicated and multifaceted disorder.</p><p><p><strong>Richard P.

Students come to appreciate that the principal resource for the course is UCC Article 9 itself. While the casebook is an essential tool for study, the law is found in the Code. Problems and Cases on Secured Transactions is carefully designed for an introductory mainstream course, not for an advanced course or seminar. The material is presented as completely comprehensible, even enjoyable, rather than an arcane science that only an insider can be expected to understand. Cases are heavily edited, and liberal editorial notes help express the vibrancy of true-life situations. A good mix of short and long problems gives each lesson a comprehensive linear flow while keeping students focused. A progressive mix of problems helps students see the common elements, as rules and principals learned in a simpler setting can readily be applied to more complex transactions. Earlier problems lean more heavily, though not exclusively, on the individual and consumer-borrower situations. As the lessons advance, the mix of materials progressively includes more small-business and large-business transactions.</p><p>Key Features of the New Edition:</p><ul><li>The latest on the 2010 Revisions to Article 9, in particular how the "name of the debtor" problem is now to be dealt with</li><li>New legislative initiatives addressing the problem of so-called "bogus" or "harassing" filings</li><li> Twelve new principal cases decided since 2010 bring the book up to date and better elucidate points to be made</li><li><p></p></li></ul></p><p>Brook is Professor of Law at New York Law School.</p><h2>Qualitative Communication Research Methods</h2><p>This book is the only guide dedicated to qualitative research methods in communication.

In fourteen engaging, beautifully written chapters, Wolosky explores in depth how poetry does what it does while offering brilliant readings of some of the finest lyric poetry in the English and American traditions. Both readers new to poetry and poetry veterans will be moved and enlightened as Wolosky interprets work by William Shakespeare, John Donne, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Sylvia Plath, and others. The book includes a superb two-chapter discussion of the sonnet's form and history, and represents the first poetry guide to introduce gender as a basic element of analysis.<br><br>In contrast to many existing guides, which focus on selected formal aspects like metrics or present definitions and examples in a handbook format, <em>The Art of Poetry</em> covers the full landscape of poetry's subtle art while showing readers how to comprehend a poetic text in all its dimensions. Other special features include Wolosky's consideration of historical background for the developments she discusses, and the way her book is designed to acquaint or reacquaint readers with the core of the lyric tradition in English.<br><br>Lively, accessible, and original, <em>The Art of Poetry</em> will be a rich source of inspiration for students, general readers, and those who teach poetry.<br></p><p><br><strong>Shira Wolosky</strong> is Professor of English and American Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br><br>"The project itself is both coherent and concise, relying on close readings of short, post-medieval poems...to introduce concepts of diction, syntax, metre, and rhyme. At its best, the book shows that clarity of discussion need not sell short depth of analysis, or complexity of awareness, and it is an excellent starting-point for any serious consideration of form in poetry, of what poetry does to language and what language is always ready to do to poetry."--Peter McDonald, <em>Poetry Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Art of Poetry</em> is both a superb technical manual and an authentic guide to the art of reading poetry. With brilliance and extraordinary lucidity, Wolosky illuminates such essential matters as metaphor, poetic voice, and the crucial relation of rhetoric to poetic meaning. I cannot imagine a more useful and distinguished book of this kind." --Harold Bloom, Yale University<p></p><br>"Wolosky has written the best basic treatment I know of the art of poetry. Wolosky structures the book brilliantly, and makes the process of learning about textual virtuosity and semantic complexity a joy. She builds her explications from the ground up (or from the surface down), always with attention to what it means to make a student get into a poem step by step. I have learned a great deal from this work, though I've been teaching poetry for twenty years. This is a genuinely important book, and I predict it will become in short time a standard text for teaching poetry."--Sacvan Bercovitch, Harvard University<p></p><br>"Here is a generous <em>Art of Poetry</em> for the modern English-speaking world. How tellingly Shira Wolosky moves from matters of taxonomy to those of technique, from the rudiments of poetic form to the resonance of poetic voice and point of view--from praxis to theory and back, from literary history to the experience of the literature itself. For at every step the author supports her claims with readings of individuals poems that are close and adept, eloquent and acute. This book is a welcome gift, an arresting vade mecum for student and teacher, reader and writer alike."--Robert Fagles, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Shira Wolosky's comprehensive and lucid practical introduction to what makes poems poetic also provides a sophisticated and informative look at theoretical poetics in all its aspects. Its annotated bibliography alone will give interested readers of all sorts a good sense of what scholars, critics, and linguists have had to say about poetry during the twentieth century. It is rare that an elementary study can also be as useful for advanced students and teachers of poetry as this well-worked-out exposition, clearly written and free of pseudotheoretical jargon."-- John Hollander, Yale University<p></p><br></p><h2>Roger Williams (Lives and Legacies Series)</h2><p>The founder of Rhode Island and of the first Baptist Church in America, an original and passionate advocate for religious freedom, a rare New England colonist who befriended Native Americans and took seriously their culture and their legal rights, Roger Williams is the forgotten giant among the first English colonists.<br> Now, Edwin S. Gaustad, a leading expert on the life of Roger Williams, offers a vividly written and authoritative biography of the most far-seeing of the early settlers--the first such biography written for a general audience. Readers follow Roger and Mary Williams on their 1631 journey to Boston, where he soon became embroiled in many controversies, most notably, his claim that the colonists had unjustly taken Native American lands and his argument that civil authorities could not enforce religious duties. Soon banished for these troubling (if farsighted) views, Williams wandered for fourteen weeks in bitter snow until he bought land from the Narragansett Indians and founded Providence, which soon became a sanctuary for religious freedom and a refuge for dissenters of all stripes. The book discusses Williams' journey back to London, where he sought legal recognition of his colony, spread his enlightened views on Native Americans, and (alongside John Milton) fought passionately for religious freedom. Gaustad also describes how the royal charter of Rhode Island, obtained by Williams in 1663, would become the blueprint of religious freedom for many other colonies and a foundation stone for the First Amendment. <br> Here then is a vibrant portrait of a great American who is truly worthy of remembrance.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edwin S. Gaustad</strong> is Professor of History and Religious Studies Emeritus at the University of California at Riverside. An authority on Roger Williams and on the subject of religious freedom, he is the author of <em>Liberty of Conscience: Roger Williams in America</em> and <em>Church and State in America</em>, and is co-author of the award-winning <em>The New Historical Atlas of Religion in America</em>.<br><br>"Not just an excellent introduction to the man but a deep analysis of his largely unacknowledged influence on our political and cultural life."--<em>Reason</em><p></p><br>"Our notions of the separation of church and state owe a lot to Williams, a deeply pious Puritan clergyman who believed that civil authorities had no business enforcing religious views....In 1635, Williams founded Rhode Island as a haven of toleration and freethinking. Gaustad's timely little book reminds us that those are the enduring foundations of American civilization."--<em>Time Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Excellent."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"This is a little masterpiece. Gaustad knows the religious literature of colonial America as well as anyone. Despite being a professional historian, he can also write sentences that sing. Williams, he tells us, understood what Thomas Jefferson was to proclaim over a century later about freedom and the human spirit. The core of our liberal political heritage began as a religious argument about souls rather than citizens."--Joseph J. Ellis, author of <em>His Excellence: George Washington</em><p></p><br>"As Gaustad makes clear in his remarkably succinct biography, Williams planted the seeds of ideas that would sprout a century after his death....He could have written several amendments to the Bill of Rights all by himself."--<em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em><p></p><br>"At once maddeningly original and disarmingly humane, Roger Williams championed Native American rights, church-state separation, and an independent judiciary when each was considered rank heresy. The justly noted historian Edwin S. Gaustad presents Williams's remarkable story in straightforward prose, without losing sight of its poetic power." --Forrest Church, author of <em>The American Creed: A Biography of the Declaration of Independence</em> and <em>The Separation of Church and State: Writings on a Fundamental Freedom by America's Founders</em><p></p><br>"Energetic, elegant."--<em>Providence Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Becoming a Critical Thinker: A User Friendly Manual</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Developing Instinctive Analytical Skills in Students</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Becoming a Critical Thinker: A User Friendly Manual</i> trains students to distinguish high-quality, well-supported arguments from those with little or no evidence to support them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It develops the skills required to effectively evaluate the many claims facing them as citizens, learners, consumers, and human beings, and also to be effective advocates for their beliefs. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Teaching and Learning Experience</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Improve Critical Thinking</i> - Coverage of persuasive speaking, decision-making, the Toulmin model of argumentation, and chapter<b>-</b>end writing and speaking exercisesall teach students to construct and present arguments so that they can gain skill and confidence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Engage Students</i> - <i>Becoming a Critical Thinker: A User Friendly Manual</i> exposes students to a variety of contemporary and multicultural issues, engaging their understanding of analytical skills through the use of articles and varied examples. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Support Instructors</i> - Teaching your course just got easier!&nbsp; You can create a Customized Text or use our Instructor&#x2019;s Manual, Electronic &#x201c;MyTest&#x201d; Test Bank or PowerPoint Presentation Slides.&nbsp; PLUS, our new Instructor&#x2019;s Manual has been updated and expanded with revised tests and answer keys, a discussion of chapter exercises, and suggestions for teaching critical thinking concepts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>This text with readings develops students&#39; basic critical thinking skills by means of several fresh materials and strategies: an easy progression from familiar, social examples to more complex, political and commercial examples; strong use of graphics; incorporation of multi-cultural examples and readings throughout; and an emphasis on print and electronic media as a way of illustrating the use of critical thinking skills in everyday life. The goal of this text is to train students how to evaluate the claims that responsible citizens, consumers, and social beings confront daily and how to construct and present effective arguments for their own beliefs.PREFACE <p> Everyone thinks. If you ask people where they stand on a particular issue, they will usually tell you what they believe and give reasons to support their beliefs. Many people, however, find it difficult to evaluate a written or spoken ,commentary on a controversial issue because both sides of the controversy seem to have good arguments. </p><p> The critical thinker is able to distinguish high-quality, well-supported arguments from arguments with little or no evidence to back them. This text trains students to evaluate the many claims facing them as citizens, learners, consumers, and human beings; it also helps students become more effective advocates for their beliefs. </p><p> Becoming a Critical Thinker is designed to be interdisciplinary and to be useful in courses in critical thinking, informal logic, rhetoric, English, speech, journalism, humanities, and the social sciences. It has also been used as a required text or a supplement in nursing programs and in workshops for staff development and business management. The skills that distinguish critical thinkers across various disciplines are presented in a clear and comprehensible manner. UNIQUE FEATURES </p><p> The process of becoming a critical thinker takes place when ideas are clearly understood and put into practice. For this reason, many elements of the text have been chosen because of their practical application for the student:</p><p>Each concept is explained with examples, and the examples often proceed from the personal to the social or political. In this way, students can see that the same skills used in understanding arguments in daily life are used in analyzing political and commercial rhetoric. Graphic illustrations help students visualize important concepts. Exercises of varying levels of difficulty are given throughout the chapters to help students practice critical thinking skills. Emphasis is placed on understanding and analyzing the impact of print and electronic media on arguments. Students are taught to construct and present arguments so that they can gain skill and confidence as advocates for their beliefs. There is an early and primary emphasis on understanding conflicting value systems and on ethics in argumentation and decision making. The articles and essays selected for use in the text are contemporary and express a variety of political viewpoints and ethical concerns. Multicultural perspectives are presented throughout the examples and articles. Many exercises and assignments encourage students to understand the perspectives of others and to broaden their own perspectives. There is a variety of writing and speaking assignments at the end of each chapter. The text is supplemented with an instructor's manual and test bank in addition to a Web site containing examples of critical thinking principles that can be used for classroom discussion. SPECIFIC CHANGES IN THE THIRD EDITION </p><p> This third edition of Becoming a Critical Thinker has been created with two priorities in mind: First, we wanted to retain and, in the cases of explanations of philosophical concepts, to improve the user friendly format of the first two editions. Also, we wanted to update readings and concepts so that readers will enjoy the application of critical thinking principles to current issues. New features in the third edition include:</p><p>Expanded supplementary resources for instructors. These include an instructor's manual with revised tests and an answer key for each chapter, discussions of chapter exercises, and suggestions for teaching critical thinking concepts. In addition, a Web site may be referenced for additional lecture material and student practice exercises. New articles and essays address current topics. This edition retains relevant articles from the second edition and includes new editorial essays and articles on such current topics as: The ethical dilemmas doctors face when deciding whether to prescribe placebos, problems in acculturation of Vietnamese immigrants, the use of expert testimony to overturn criminal convictions, the use of suggestion by retailers, citizen reactions to the new multiracial categories in the U.S. census, and a lawyer's use of listening to persuade jurors. New user friendly elements elucidate many of the basic concepts covered in the first and second editions. The definition of critical thinking and argumentation has been expanded with an emphasis on the distinction between argument and conflict. The sections on causation and deductive reasoning have been clarified with more relevant explanations and new illustrations. Stereotyping and conformity (including groupthink) are discussed as hindrances to critical thinking. A new outline on the topic of organ donation has been added to Chapter 10. Each chapter ends with a "Chapter Checkup" that tests students' knowledge of the information covered. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS </p><p> My husband, John Diestler, remains an invaluable help in many ways. He provided expertise on the "user friendly" format; he worked out preliminary designs for the original and the new logos and figures in the text; and he made useful suggestions on the manuscript throughout its production. </p><p> I thank my editor, Katie Janssen, for her encouragement and expert guidance that enabled me to complete this edition in a timely manner. I remain grateful to Maggie Barbieri for her dedicated work on the first edition. I appreciate Edie Riker for her diligence, patience, and professionalism as she supervised the production of this text. </p><p> I am grateful to students who used the text and made useful suggestions for additions and changes: Warda Javed, Marites Ayson, Stephanie Jensen, and Malik Ali. Suzanne Barton helped me with manuscript changes and Helen Kalkstein, Rafaella del Bourgo, and Connie Anderson suggested interesting and relevant additions to the text. Several presenters and participants from the annual Conference on Critical Thinking at Sonoma State University, including William Dorman, Perry Weddle, Connie Missimer, Marlys Mayfield, Betty Duffy, and John Splaine, kindly shared a variety of relevant research material. </p><p> In addition, I wish to thank the reviewers for their invaluable advice and encouragement: Connie Anderson, Contra Costa College; Eileen Smith, Shasta University; Marek Wosinski, Arizona State University; Angela M. Gulick, University of Alaska-Anchorage; and Laura Lun Inglis, Buena Vista University. </p><p> For their practical help that allowed me the time and energy to write the text, I thank my father, A1 Goldstein and John, Zachary, Jenna, Laura, and Amy Diestler. </p><p> Above all, I am grateful to the Creator of the human mind.</p></p><h2>Conducting a Successful Capital Campaign: The New, Revised and Expanded Edition of the Leading Guide to Planning and Implementing a Capital Campaign</h2><p>"This book is highly recommended for development professionals, as well as board members and administrators who believe that a few million can easily be raised by development personnel in their spare time."<br> &#x2014;<i>National Society of Fund Raising Executives Journal</i> on the 1st edition <p><i>Conducting a Successful Capital Campaign</i> has been the definitive resource on capital campaigns for a decade.

If you have OCD, it will help you stop trying to replace your negative thoughts with positive ones. This book will free you to accept <i>all </i>your thoughts, and give up the pursuit of certainty. The authors clearly explain the value of surrender, allowing worry without being dominated by it. If you care about someone with OCD, this book will show you how to stop offering unproductive reassurance and help this person embrace a challenging life.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>David L.

It&#x2019;s the only book specifically on reassurance, and it explains in great detail the categories of fears that keep reassurance going. If you compulsively seek reassurance, after reading this book, you may feel understood and empowered in ways that you haven&#x2019;t previously felt. It offers helpful clarifications about unproductive reassurance seeking, unhelpful self-talk, and common categories of reassurance traps.

Martin Seif and Sally Winston have written an excellent book that addresses this theme common to so many of the anxiety disorders.

E. Cummings: Complete Poems, 1904&#x2013;1962</h2><p><p><strong>Presented here in a bold new edition, E. E. Cummings: Complete Poems 1904&#x2013;1962 showcases Cummings&#x2019;s transcendent body of work, collected in its entirety.</strong></p><p>Combining Thoreau&#x2019;s controlled belligerence with the brash abandon of an uninhibited bohemian, E. E. Cummings, together with Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and William Carlos Williams, helped bring about the twentieth-century revolution in literary expression. Today Cummings is recognized as the author of some of the most sensuous lyric poems in the English language, as well as one of the most inventive American poets of his time. Formally fractured and yet gleefully alive and whole, at once cubistic and figurative, Cummings&#x2019;s work expanded the boundaries of what language is and can do.</p><p>With a new introduction by Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning poet Stephen Dunn, this redesigned, newly corrected, and fully reset edition of <em>Complete Poems</em> collects and presents all the poems published or designated for publication by E. E. Cummings in his lifetime. It includes 36 poems that were first collected in the 1991 edition and 164 unpublished poems issued in 1983 under the title Etcetera. It spans his earliest creations, his vivacious linguistic acrobatics, up through his last valedictory sonnets.</p><p>In the words of Randall Jarrell, &#x201c;No one else has ever made avant-garde, experimental poems so attractive to the general and special reader.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><strong>E. E. Cummings</strong> (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. He was also a playwright, a painter, and a writer of prose. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard University and, during World War I, served with an ambulance corps in France. He spent three months in a French detention camp and subsequently wrote <em>The Enormous Room</em>, a highly acclaimed criticism of World War I. After the war, Cummings returned to the States and published his first collection of poetry, <em>Tulips &amp; Chimneys</em>, which was characterized by his innovative style: pushing the boundaries of language and form while discussing love, nature, and war with sensuousness and glee. He spent the rest of his life painting, writing poetry, and enjoying widespread popularity and success.</p><p><strong>George J. Firmage</strong> edited many works by Cummings, including <em>Erotic Poems</em>; <em>Complete Poems, 1904&#x2013; 1962</em>; and <em>Fairy Tales</em>.</p><p><strong>Stephen Dunn</strong> is the author of nineteen poetry collections, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <em>Different Hours</em>, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the recipient of an Academy Award for Literature. His poems have appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Atlantic</em>, and <em>American Poetry Review</em>, among many other publications. A distinguished professor emeritus at Richard Stockton University, he lives in Frostburg, Maryland.</p>&#x201c;One of the greatest lyric poets in our language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Logan, <em>Modern American Poetry</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;To return to...his poems is to return to a buoyancy and boisterousness, of course, but also to an odd bountifulness...[encapsulating] a profound sense of wonder and wistfulness.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Muldoon, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Cummings was one of the most spirited and original American writers of the 20th century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong></p><h2>Walled States, Waning Sovereignty (Zone Books)</h2><p><p><b>Why do nation-states wall themselves off despite widespread proclamations of global connectedness?</b></p><p>Why do walls marking national boundaries proliferate amid widespread proclamations of global connectedness and despite anticipation of a world without borders? Why are barricades built of concrete, steel, and barbed wire when threats to the nation today are so often miniaturized, vaporous, clandestine, dispersed, or networked?</p><p>In <i>Walled States, Waning Sovereignty</i>, Wendy Brown considers the recent spate of wall building in contrast to the erosion of nation-state sovereignty. Drawing on classical and contemporary political theories of state sovereignty in order to understand how state power and national identity persist amid its decline, Brown considers both the need of the state for legitimacy and the popular desires that incite the contemporary building of walls. The new walls&#x2015;dividing Texas from Mexico, Israel from Palestine, South Africa from Zimbabwe&#x2015;consecrate the broken boundaries they would seem to contest and signify the ungovernability of a range of forces unleashed by globalization. Yet these same walls often amount to little more than theatrical props, frequently breached, and blur the distinction between law and lawlessness that they are intended to represent. But if today's walls fail to resolve the conflicts between globalization and national identity, they nonetheless project a stark image of sovereign power. Walls, Brown argues, address human desires for containment and protection in a world increasingly without these provisions. Walls respond to the wish for horizons even as horizons are vanquished.</p></p><p>Wendy Brown is Class of 1936 First Chair of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is also affiliated with the Department of Rhetoric and the Critical Theory Program and the author of <i>Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's Stealth Revolution</i> (Zone Books).<p>Brown's thesis, summarily put, is that modern-day walls are discredited markers of failing sovereignty. What is sovereignty? It is the revealed will of a political association to dispose of its own affairs. As that definition implies, it contains an irreducible element of the de facto. For Brown, sovereignty is now a ragged oriflamme, a willful but doomed exercise in self-persuasion.</p>&#x2015;<b>Glen Newey</b>, <i>London Review of Books</i></p><h2>The I. L.

Its tragic history of two families unfolds against the backdrop of the post-Reconstruction South and climaxes with a race riot based on an actual 1898 incident.

Bowler and Iwan Rhys Morus, expands our knowledge and control of the world in ways that affect-but are also affected by-society and culture. In <i>Making Modern Science</i>, a text designed for introductory college courses in the history of science and as a single-volume introduction for the general reader, Bowler and Morus explore both the history of science itself and its influence on modern thought.<br> <br> Opening with an introduction that explains developments in the history of science over the last three decades and the controversies these initiatives have engendered, the book then proceeds in two parts. The first section considers key episodes in the development of modern science, including the Scientific Revolution and individual accomplishments in geology, physics, and biology. The second section is an analysis of the most important themes stemming from the social relations of science-the discoveries that force society to rethink its religious, moral, or philosophical values. <i>Making Modern Scienc</i>e thus chronicles all major developments in scientific thinking, from the revolutionary ideas of the seventeenth century to the contemporary issues of evolutionism, genetics, nuclear physics, and modern cosmology.<br> <br> Written by seasoned historians, this book will encourage students to see the history of science not as a series of names and dates but as an interconnected and complex web of relationships between science and modern society. The first survey of its kind, <i>Making Modern Science</i> is a much-needed and accessible introduction to the history of science, engagingly written for undergraduates and curious readers alike.<br></p></p><p><b>Peter J.

The author of this lively and fascinating little book, which both attracted and offended large numbers of readers in Victorian America, was George G. Foster, reporter for Horace Greeley's influential <i>New York Tribune,</i> social commentator, poet, and man about town. Foster drew on his daily and nightly rambles through the city's streets and among the characters of the urban <i>demi-monde</i> to produce a sensationalized but extraordinarily revealing portrait of New York at the moment it was emerging as a major metropolis. Reprinted here with sketches from two of Foster's other books, <i>New York by Gas-Light</i> will be welcomed by students of urban social history, popular culture, literature, and journalism.<br><br>Editor Stuart M. Blumin has provided a penetrating introductory essay that sets Foster's life and work in the contexts of the growing city, the development of the mass-distribution publishing industry, the evolving literary genre of urban sensationalism, and the wider culture of Victorian America. This is an important reintroduction to a significant but neglected work, a prologue to the urban realism that would flourish later in the fiction of Stephen Crane, the painting of George Bellows, and the journalism of Jacob Riis.</p><p><b>Stuart M.

This popular book blends both theory and application to equip the reader with an understanding of the basic principles necessary to apply regression model-building techniques in a wide variety of application environments. It assumes a working knowledge of basic statistics and a familiarity with hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, as well as the normal, t, x2, and F distributions.<br> <br> Illustrating all of the major procedures employed by the contemporary software packages MINITAB(r), SAS(r), and S-PLUS(r), the Fourth Edition begins with a general introduction to regression modeling, including typical applications. A host of technical tools are outlined, such as basic inference procedures, introductory aspects of model adequacy checking, and polynomial regression models and their variations. The book discusses how transformations and weighted least squares can be used to resolve problems of model inadequacy and also how to deal with influential observations. Subsequent chapters discuss:<br> * Indicator variables and the connection between regression and analysis-of-variance models<br> * Variable selection and model-building techniques and strategies<br> * The multicollinearity problem--its sources, effects, diagnostics, and remedial measures<br> * Robust regression techniques such as M-estimators, and properties of robust estimators<br> * The basics of nonlinear regression<br> * Generalized linear models<br> * Using SAS(r) for regression problems<br> <br> This book is a robust resource that offers solid methodology for statistical practitioners and professionals in the fields of engineering, physical and chemical sciences, economics, management, life and biological sciences, and the social sciences. Both the accompanying FTP site, which contains data sets, extensive problem solutions, software hints, and PowerPoint(r) slides, as well as the book's revised presentation of topics in increasing order of complexity, facilitate its use in a classroom setting.<br> <br> With its new exercises and structure, this book is highly recommended for upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics, engineering, and natural sciences.

The first essay traces the destruction of slavery by discussing the shift from a war for the Union to a war against slavery. The slaves are shown to have shaped the destiny of the nation through their determination to place their liberty on the wartime agenda. The second essay examines the evolution of freedom in occupied areas of the lower and upper South. The struggle of those freed to obtain economic independence in difficult wartime circumstances indicates conflicting conceptions of freedom among former slaves and slaveholders, Northern soldiers and civilians. The third essay demonstrates how the enlistment and military service of nearly 200,000 slaves hastened the transformation of the war into a struggle for universal liberty, and how this experience shaped the lives of former slaves long after the war had ended.</p><p>Three essays depict the emancipation of the slaves during the Civil War by tracing the destruction of slavery, examining the evolution of freedom and finally demonstrating how the war itself was transformed into a struggle for universal liberty.Drawn from the documentary history of emancipation that has been described as &#39;this generation&#39;s most significant encounter with the American past&#39; (The New York Times), Slaves No More brings together three essays on the destruction of slavery and the redefinition of freedom in the midst of the nation&#39;s bloodiest conflict.</p><h2>Guerrilla Warfare (Latin American Silhouettes)</h2><p>Che Guevara, the larger-than-life hero of the 1959 revolutionary victory that overturned the Cuban dictatorship, believed that revolution would also topple the imperialist governments in Latin America. Che's call to action, his proclamation of "invincibility"-the ultimate victory of revolutionary forces-continues to influence the course of Latin American history and international relations. His amazing life story has lifted him to almost legendary status.<p> This edition of Che's classic work <i>Guerrilla Warfare</i> contains the text of his book, as well as two later essays titled "Guerrilla Warfare: A Method" and "Message to the Tricontinental." A detailed introduction by Brian Loveman and Thomas M. Davies, Jr., examines Guevara's text, his life and political impact, the situation in Latin America, and the United States' response to Che and to events in Latin America. Loveman and Davies also provide in-depth case studies that apply Che's theories on revolution to political situations in seven Latin American countries from the 1960s to the present. Also included are political chronologies of each country discussed in the case studies and a postscript tying the analyses together.</p> This book will help students gain a better understanding of Che's theoretical contribution to revolutionary literature and the inspiration that his life and <i>Guerrilla Warfare</i> have provided to revolutionaries since the 1960s. <p> This volume is an invaluable addition to courses in Latin American studies and political science. </p></p><p>October 1997 marks the 30th anniversary of the assassination of Che. <i>Guerrilla Warfare</i> is Che, in his own words.Ernesto Che Guevara (1928 1967) was born in Rosario, Argentina, and became attracted to Marxist theory after witnessing the conditions in South America as a young medical student. He went on to serve as a military advisor to Fidel Castro and as guerrilla commander against Batista forces during the Cuban Revolution. After Castro s insurgent victory, he served in various posts but left the Cuban government to take the ideas of the Cuban revolution around the world. He later took part in guerrilla action in Bolivia, where he was executed by government forces. Nearly a half century after his death, Che remains a potent revolutionary and cultural figure.</p><h2>Nocturne: Night in American Art, 1890&#x2013;1917</h2><p><b>A beautifully illustrated look at the vogue for night landscapes amid the social, political, and technological changes of modern America</b><br><br> The turn of the 20th century witnessed a surge in the creation and popularity of nocturnes and night landscapes in American art. In this original and thought-provoking book, H�l�ne Valance investigates why artists and viewers of the era were so captivated by the night. <i>Nocturne&nbsp;</i>examines works by artists such as James McNeill Whistler, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer, Frederic Remington, Edward Steichen, and Henry Ossawa Tanner through the lens of the scientific developments and social issues that dominated the period. Valance argues that the success of the genre is connected to the resonance between the night and the many forces that affected the era, including technological advances that expanded the realm of the visible, such as electric lighting and photography; Jim Crow&#x2013;era race relations; America&#x2019;s closing frontier and imperialism abroad; and growing anxiety about identity and social values amid rapid urbanization. This absorbing study features 150 illustrations encompassing paintings, photographs, prints, scientific illustration, advertising, and popular media to explore the predilection for night imagery as a sign of the times.</p><p>The turn-of-the-century vogue for night landscapes is examined through the technological, social, and political changes that affected the era in this absorbing and original study.&nbsp;<b>H�l�ne Valance</b> is assistant professor at the Universit� de Franche-Comt�.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Maigret and the Lazy Burglar (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b><b><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

He redefined the central task of philosophy as the investigation of the nature of being, and has exerted a profound impact on literary theory, theology, psychotherapy, political theory, aesthetics, environmental studies, as well as mainstream philosophy. His thought has contributed to the recent turn to hermeneutics in philosophy and the social sciences, and to current post-modern and post-structuralist developments. The disclosing of his deep involvement in the ideology of Nazism has provoked much debate about the relation of philosophy to politics. This volume contains both overviews of Heidegger&#39;s life and works and analysis of his most important work, Being and Time. In addition there are discussions of Heidegger&#39;s thought in relation to mysticism, traditional theology, ecology, psychotherapy, and the philosophy of language.

In 1905 he self-published <b><i>The Gods of Pegana</i></b>, and its critical and popular success impelled the publication of numerous other collections of short stories, including <b><i>A Dreamer&#x2019;s Tales</i></b> (1910), <b><i>The Book of Wonder</i></b> (1912), and<i> <b>The Last Book of Wonder</b></i> (1916). Dunsany also distinguished himself as a dramatist, and his early plays&#x2014;collected in <b><i>Five Plays</i></b> (1914) and<i> <b>Plays of Gods and Men</b></i> (1917)&#x2014;were successful in Ireland, England, and the United States.

There was plenty of fishing and shooting, but no news; for nothing in Rathgeel ever seemed to happen. The weather may have changed a bit at times in Rath geel, but not while he was there; the wind blew warm and damp from the south-west all the time, and all the thorn trees sloped the same way, as though that one wind had been blowing for ever.</p><p>And the odd thing was, as it seemed to Draffin, the young journalist I have mentioned, nobody seemed to want anything new to happen; they complained a bit while they were talking of the weather and the crops, the price of cattle and one or two other things, but they never seemed in their hearts to want anything new. And Draffin was lonely and homesick for want of news, good as the fishing was, and the shooting too.</p><p>And then one day a man called William Smith was found ly ing dead in a narrow old sunken lane, where nobody went but an odd tramp, and he had been lying there nearly a week when they found him, and there were some bullet-holes in him.</p><p>This was like dawn to Draffin after a long night. News at last! And he ran round, with his notebook open in his hand, to all the acquaintances that he had made during his holiday, to get the details of it. And nothing could he get.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought the Irish were a talkative people,&#x201d; he said to one of them at last, a tall, dark, thin man called Michael Heggarty.</p><p>&#x201c;And so we are,&#x201d; said Heggarty.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you are the dumbest people in the whole world,&#x201d; said Draffin. &#x201c;And that's not excepting the people in deaf-and-dumb asylums.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; said Heggarty.</p><p>&#x201c;I am sure it is,&#x201d; replied Draffin.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe that's because you don't use the right key,&#x201d; said Heggarty. &#x201c;You would not say there was no money in the Bank of England because you couldn't open the vaults. But there's a key to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What's the key here?&#x201d; asked Draffin.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, it's whiskey,&#x201d; said Heggarty, &#x201c;if you can find the right man for it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And who's the right man?&#x201d; asked Draffin.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, I'd not like to be telling you,&#x201d; said Heggarty.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, one must make a beginning,&#x201d; said Draffin, &#x201c;so I'll be gin by trying you, if you wouldn't mind coming in here.&#x201d; For they were standing outside the white wall of Jimmy Doyle's public-house, under its dark thatch.</p><p>And they went inside and whiskey was ordered by Draffin and drunk by them both, sitting together at a table, and the heavy silence continued. And Draffin paid for more whiskey, and that was drunk too. And in the few minutes that went by af ter that the little room seemed to grow darker in the autumn after noon, but a light was growing in the eyes of Heggarty. And then Draffin said half to himself and half to the far wall at which he was gazing, &#x201c;I wonder what happened to William Smith.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I'll tell you,&#x201d; said Heggarty. &#x201c;It was like this. He comes over here from England, or from some place where they must be very ignorant, about a year ago, and he buys a bit of land to do some farming, and he settles down all alone in the farm house on it. I wouldn't say he didn't understand farming, but he was terrible ignorant of the land and all the ways of it. And there was a lone thorn in a field that he wanted to plough, an old thorn, what was left of it by the ages, and he said it would get in the way of the plough.</p><p>&#x201c;There was no harm in ploughing the field, but it stands to reason he could have run a plough round the tree, and by bend ing his head a bit he could have got under the branches, and the horse too, for a horse would have had more sense than what he had. But he couldn't see that, and he must cut down the tree, a lone thorn of the fairies, one that the Little People had danced round for ages.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he asks several young men to cut it, but none of them would do anything so foolish and made various excuses. So what does he do but he gets an axe and he cuts it down himself. And nobody says a word at first. We was all too horrified. And then some of us goes to old Timmy Maguire to hear what he will say. And we tells him what William Smith has done, and he had heard already, and old Timmy Maguire says, 'No matter. You only have to wait. Watch him and wait and see what the Little People will do. For I never knew anybody do anything agin them without they being revenged on him; never yet, and I've lived to be ninety.'</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that satisfied all of us, except one young fellow who must always be asking questions.</p><p>&#x201c;What'll they do to him?' he says.</p><p>&#x201c;You have only to watch,' says old Timmy Maguire. 'They will take his luck away. Watch his luck and see what happens to it. I never knew the Little People leave a man's luck when he had offended them, not a shred of it. I never saw them do that in ninety years.'</p><p>&#x201c;And did you often see them at it?' asks the young fellow.</p><p>&#x201c;Begob,' says old Timmy Maguire, 'many's the time I seen them take all a man's luck right away to the mountains, nor I never seen it come back.'</p><p>&#x201c;'Sure, that's terrible,' says one of us.</p><p>&#x201c;It's what they do,' says old Timmy Maguire.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we all decides to do what old Timmy Maguire says, and to watch the luck of William Smith and to see what hap pens to it; and what happens is this: it's the most extraordinary part of my story, but it's the truth I'm telling you. William Smith puts five pounds on a horse a few days later that's run ning at a hundred to one. Well, that's tempting your luck to leave you; no horse is going to win at a hundred to one, and it's throwing five pounds away, and a man who begins like that will throw everything away. But this horse wins and the bookie pays and we all says, 'What about the Little People?'</p><p>&#x201c;And that isn't all. There's a competition next week to guess the number of rabbits that there are in County Meath, with a motor-car for a prize for the man whose guess is nearest. And William Smith guesses the right number within three, and he gets the motor-car. And the Little People says nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;And it doesn't stop there. For a few days later he sells a horse for a thousand pounds what he had bought out of a cart for twenty-five pounds, either knowing something about a horse or finding a man that thought he did; but it was luck ei ther way. Ay, out of a cart, and he sells it for a thousand pounds. And that wasn't all, nor nearly all, but I won't weary you with telling you all of it, and maybe you wouldn't believe me if I did; but he had a run of luck such as no one ever saw, and it went on week after week, and was an insult to those that dance under the moon.</p><p>&#x201c;And we goes to old Timmy Maguire and says, 'What about it now?' And he says, 'Only wait.' And that man Smith's run of luck went on and on. And then he backs another horse in a race and it was three to one on, and he puts on six hundred pounds to win two hundred; and he could afford to do that when he knew that he couldn't lose. And it was just the same as the horse at a hundred to one, and he gets two hundred pounds.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that was the limit, and something had to be done. It was no use asking old Timmy Maguire, who would say noth ing but 'Wait' or 'Watch him.' We had to do something our selves. I had nothing to do with it myself, because I have always kept away from religion and politics and all them kind of things, and I says to the rest of the boys, 'I'll have no hand in it'; and they says, 'Sure, we all respect your principles. At the same time the Little People are being insulted by this man's luck, as though they didn't exist, or as though there were noth ing sacred in their old thorns, and we can't allow that kind of thing in a place like Rathgeel.' And I had to agree that that was so: what else could I say? Though I took no part in it myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, when the boys was gone I goes once more to old Timmy Maguire to tell him that the young lads is getting impatient. 'Sure, they needn't be,' says he. 'For I never knew any man to hold his luck against that people, and they'll be avenged for their thorn.'</p><p>&#x201c;It was no use telling him of all the good luck that was con tinually coming to William Smith, for he wouldn't listen, but only-says to me, 'Wait.'</p><p>&#x201c;Well, the young lads goes that night to the house of William Smith, and they finds him sitting at a table totting up the figures of all the money that had been coming his way ever since he cut down the old thorn, and there was little smiles on his face. That is what the boys told me afterwards, and I only tell you what they told me, but I can't say exactly what happened when I wasn't there myself, but was at home with my poor old mother who had a cold and wanted me to look after her.</p><p>&#x201c;But the young lads came to William Smith and say to him, 'Rathgeel was always a quiet place, where no one takes any part in religion or politics and never interferes with anyone, whatever his religion is. At the same time,' they says, 'if anyone thinks that they can come here from England and buy a farm and insult those that dance round the thorn, and make money that many a man would be glad of with an old mother to sup port, as though his luck hadn't changed and the Little People didn't exist, is greatly mistaken, as you'll soon find out if you don't give up all the money you've made since you desecrated the thorn, and a great deal more besides, till you've given up to fellows that will know how to use it properly, as much as you would have lost if your luck had turned against you weeks ago, as it should; if you know what we mean, and if you don't it's a bullet you'll get, which may help to teach you.'</p><p>&#x201c;That's what the young lads told me they said to him. And William Smith says nothing, and they sees he is in two minds what to do; and Rathgeel being a quiet place, as I told you and as you've seen for yourself, where no trouble of any sort ever occurred, and they not wanting its name to become a byword from having a man there that was insulting the Little People and growing fat on it, and interfering with their dancing at night, for a lone thorn is their ballroom, they asks him to step outside with them, before he can make up his mind for fear he would make it up wrong. And they takes him to that bohereen where the body was found, and what happened there they none of them told me, so there's no knowing, and it's no use any man saying there is.</p><p>&#x201c;But they goes to old Timmy Maguire and tells him that William Smith is dead, and what ought they to do now? And old Timmy Maguire says, 'Sure, there's nothing more for any body to do. Didn't I tell you that all you had to do was wait?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Navigating the Social World: A Curriculum for Individuals with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, High Functioning Autism and Related Disorders</h2><p>Pediatrician Jeanie McAfee originally created this user-friendly social curriculum for her daughter Rachel, who was diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s at age ten.

The goddesses are meticulously researched and brilliantly analyzed.

But for a year and a half, he worked in the admissions office of a bucolic New England college that is known for its high academic standards, beautiful campus, and social conscience. Ambitious high schoolers and savvy guidance counselors know that admission here is highly competitive. But creating classes, Stevens finds, is a lot more complicated than most people imagine.</p><p>Admissions officers love students but they work for the good of the school. They must bring each class in "on budget," burnish the statistics so crucial to institutional prestige, and take care of their colleagues in the athletic department and the development office. Stevens shows that the job cannot be done without "systematic preferencing," and racial affirmative action is the least of it. Kids have an edge if their parents can pay full tuition, if they attend high schools with exotic zip codes, if they are athletes--especially football players--and even if they are popular. </p><p>With novelistic flair, sensitivity to history, and a keen eye for telling detail, Stevens explains how elite colleges and universities have assumed their central role in the production of the nation's most privileged classes. <i>Creating a Class</i> makes clear that, for better or worse, these schools now define the standards of youthful accomplishment in American culture more generally.</p></p><p>Mitchell L. Stevens is Associate Professor of Education and (by courtesy) Sociology at Stanford University. He is the author of <i>Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement</i>.Skillfully blending facts and figures with evocative case studies, Mitchell Stevens illuminates the process of admissions to an elite college, and shows how vexed and conflicted it is. (Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education, Harvard University)<br><br>At the most influential American colleges, growing competition to be selective and to be selected is undermining the democratic values traditionally entrusted to higher education. Rather than serving as routes to social mobility, many college admission offices end up perpetuating the status quo. Mitchell Stevens's thoughtful and eloquent book illuminates the machinations of the system-- and its consequences. (Lloyd Thacker, President, Education Conservancy and editor of <i>College Unranked</i>)<br><br>This fascinating book uses fly-on-the-wall reporting to show how decision-makers at a prestigious liberal arts college unwittingly perpetuate an American elite. Mitchell Stevens has done a real service by pulling back the curtain on the secretive college admissions process. (Susan Coll, author of <i>Acceptance: A Novel</i>)<br><br>Stevens is a storyteller, an ethnographer who takes readers on an 18-month journey as an admissions counselor. He skillfully paints a rich description of how admissions officers at a private, highly selective, liberal arts college make decisions, and explains why the ability to assemble strong applications is not evenly distributed across the population...Stevens states that his book is about privileged families and the organizational machinery in place to pass comfortable social positions on to their children. The book does much more...This text is a must read for undergraduate students, faculty, and parents. (A. A. Hodge <i>Choice</i> 2008-05-01)<br><br>Mitchell Stevens gives a fascinating behind-the-scenes account of how prestigious colleges make [admissions] decisions and shows how what they decide has shaped the lifestyle and values of upper-middle-class America...It is his first-hand experience that makes the book such a gem--Stevens' narrative brings us into the thought-world of the admissions office itself, allowing the reader to view the process from the inside out. (Jordan Hylden <i>First Things</i> 2008-04-01)<br><br>Merit may have displaced money as the primary calling card for admission to an elite college, but readers of this book may wonder if much has really changed.

He&#x2019;s completely alone &#x2014; or so he thinks until he finds the ghost girl. She has no toes, wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird, and gives him a stick that can make fire.<br>Daphne, sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy, almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy. Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark. She&#x2019;s certain her father, distant cousin of the Royal family, will come and rescue her but it seems, for now, that all she has for company is the boy and the foul-mouthed ship&#x2019;s parrot, until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island. Together, Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things (including how to milk a pig, and why spitting in beer is a good thing), and start to forge a new nation.<br><br>Encompassing themes of death and nationhood, Terry Pratchett&#x2019;s new novel is, as can be expected, extremely funny, witty and wise. Mau&#x2019;s ancestors have something to teach us all. Mau just wishes they would shut up about it and let him get on with saving everyone&#x2019;s lives!</p><p>Terry Pratchett is the author of the phenomenally successful Discworld series. His first Discworld novel for children, <b>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</b> was awarded the 2001 Carnegie Medal.Starred Review. Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;In this first novel for young people set outside of Discworld, Pratchett again shows his humor and humanity. Worlds are destroyed and cultures collide when a tsunami hits islands in a vast ocean much like the Pacific. Mau, a boy on his way back home from his initiation period and ready for the ritual that will make him a man, is the only one of his people, the Nation, to survive. Ermintrude, a girl from somewhere like Britain in a time like the 19th century, is on her way to meet her father, the governor of the Mothering Sunday islands. She is the sole survivor of her ship (or so she thinks), which is wrecked on Mau's island. She reinvents herself as Daphne, and uses her wits and practical sense to help the straggling refugees from nearby islands who start arriving. When raiders land on the island, they are led by a mutineer from the wrecked ship, and Mau must use all of his ingenuity to outsmart him. Then, just as readers are settling in to thinking that all will be well in the new world that Daphne and Mau are helping to build, Pratchett turns the story on its head. The main characters are engaging and interesting, and are the perfect medium for the author's sly humor. Daphne is a close literary cousin of Tiffany Aching in her common sense and keen intelligence wedded to courage. A rich and thought-provoking read.&#x2014;<i>Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This handsome new compilation of some of the world's greatest fairy tales abounds in timeless stories of the struggle of good against evil, bravery in the face of overwhelming danger, and virtue rewarded with everlasting love. <br>Recounted to Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm almost two centuries ago by European storytellers, the tales possess all of the most engaging elements of folklore &#x2014; from magic spells and enchanted frogs to a colorful cast of noble princes, lovely maidens, giants, witches, and other fantastic characters. <br>These 21 unabridged tales, selected from the more than 200 collected by the Brothers Grimm, include such unforgettable classics as "Snow White," "The Elves and the Shoemaker," "The Brave Little Tailor," "The Golden Goose," "Hansel and Gretel," "Little Red Riding Hood," "Rumpelstiltskin," "Rapunzel," and "Tom Thumb." </p><p></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>FISHING BAMBOO: One Man&#39;s Love Affair with Bamboo Fly Rods</h2><p>A finely tuned portrait of the pleasures of fishing with a bamboo rod, by the author of <i>Trout Bum</i>. <br></p><p>Whether you're interested in fishing or collecting bamboo fly-rods--or you simply enjoy good outdoors writing--you'll find it all in this paean to the slightly arcane world of the bamboo enthusiast. There's enough information here for those in need of an overview, including chapters on the history of bamboo rod-building, the master craftsmen of the past, and types of rods, plus the usual assortment of folksy wisdom and well-turned phrases that one expects from the author of <i>Trout Bum</i> and <i>Sex, Death and Fly-fishing</i>. Appendixes include listings of current manufacturers and dealers of bamboo fly-rods.Fishing Bamboo is an attempt to answer some of the most commonly asked questions about split bamboo fly rods: Who fishes them and why do they do it? Are they really better than graphite? Who makes them? Who sells them? Why do they cost so much? And what the hell are you trying to prove? One bamboo maker thinks the book will save a lot of time on the telephone. He said "When someone calls and asks, 'So, what's the deal on these things anyway?' I can just say, "Buy Gierach's book.'"There's a lot of interest in bamboo rods, or at least curiosity about them. They've been around since before the Civil War and for much of that time almost all fly rods - cheap, expensive, and in between - were made of split bamboo. They're a large part of the tradition and mythology of fly fishing, but some fishermen are surprised to learn that they're as alive and well now as they've ever been. In fact, some of the split bamboo rods being built today are among the best ever made.Think of Fishing Bamboo as an introduction to bamboo rods and to the subculture of people who make, buy, sell, collect, and fish with them.

Natural Hygiene (NH) is an alternative medicine originating from the Nature Cure movement. It is a form of vitalism that considers self-healing the best and only cure for disease, and favors fasting as restorative and favors dietary and other lifestyle measures as preventative. It is generally against medical treatment, with the exception of surgery in certain situations, such as for broken bones and to &#34;remove a deadly secondary cause.&#34; The movement originated with Isaac Jennings, who, after practicing traditional medicine for 20 years, began formulating his ideas about Natural Hygiene in 1822. Several other mostly later thinkers, including Sylvester Graham, influenced the movement or are considered important to it. The founder of Natural Hygiene, Herbert Shelton, became a major writer on the topic.</p><p></p><h2>Inherit the Wind (Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>The accused was a slight, frightened man who had&nbsp;&nbsp;deliberately broken the law.

Interwoven with the straw, sticks, and grass was a thick hank of human hair.<br>But who and where was the victim? What was the cause of death? No one in the girl's neighborhood had seen or heard anything unusual the previous summer. Then, on the floor of a nearby doghouse, and scattered throughout the woods and fields by wild animals, Gunther finds more - bone fragments, a piece of jaw, and a single glittering gold tooth, engraved with a mysterious symbol.<br>While this last discovery allows Joe to finally identify the victim, he is still left with more questions than answers, along with the haunting suspicion that more is yet to come. And in short order, a series of seemingly unrelated events quickly follows suit: an activist vanishes into the night without a trace...a homeless man meets a horrible death, racked by unexplainable seizures...a hateful old lady with only months left to live is strangled in a nursing home.

Soon after, he disappeared while flying a reconnaissance mission over occupied France. Neither his plane nor his body was ever found. <b>The Tale of the Rose</b> is Consuelo&#x2019;s account of their extraordinary marriage. It is a love story about a pilot and his wife, a man who yearned for the stars and the spirited woman who gave him the strength to fulfill his dreams.<br><br>Consuelo Suncin Sandoval de G�mez and Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry met in Buenos Aires in 1930&#x2014;she a seductive young widow, he a brave pioneer of early aviation, decorated for his acts of heroism in the deserts of North Africa. He was large in his passions, a fierce loner with a childlike appetite for danger. She was frail and voluble, exotic and capricious. Within hours of their first encounter, he knew he would have her as his wife.<br><br>Their love affair and marriage would take them from Buenos Aires to Paris to Casablanca to New York. It would take them through periods of betrayal and infidelity, pain and intense passion, devastating abandonment and tender, poetic love. Several times in the course of their marriage they would go their separate ways, but always they would return. <b>The Tale of the Rose</b> is the story of a man of extravagant dreams, and of the woman who was his muse, the inspiration for the Little Prince&#x2019;s beloved rose&#x2014;unique in all the world&#x2014;whom he could not live with and could not live without.<br><br>Written on Long Island in a quiet spell of reconciliation, <b>The Little Prince</b> was Antoine&#x2019;s greatest gift to the woman he never stopped loving, the only child to emerge from their union. <b>The Tale of the Rose</b> is Consuelo&#x2019;s reply&#x2014;the love letter she never could write to her husband&#x2014;a fable of its own, just as magical, poetic, and tragic as <b>The Little Prince. </b></p><p>Reading his wife's lyrical yet frank memoir of their turbulent marriage, it's easy to see why Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry (1900-1944) depicted her as the prince's beloved, difficult Rose in his most famous book, <i>The Little Prince</i>. The French writer's feelings for his Salvadoran wife were passionate from the moment they met in Buenos Aires. On that very first day in 1930, he cajoled her aboard his airplane, even though she was afraid of flying, and extorted a kiss by cutting the engine and threatening to drown them both in the waters below. He proposed marriage just a few days later, and the revolution roiling Argentina was hardly more unsettling for Consuelo than the emotions aroused by her swashbuckling aviator-author. "For you I am nothing but a dream," she explains. "But I want you to know I am not an object or a doll; I don't change faces on command." Blending the everyday with the abstract in a style reminiscent of <i>The Little Prince</i>'s elliptical prose, Consuelo limns a man who loved her yet couldn't resist the adulation of other women or sit still long enough to build a life together. "You're the kind of man who is constantly in need of struggle, conquest," she tells him. "Leave, then. Leave." So off he went, on flights that often ended in crashes while she waited anxiously (but seldom patiently)--until he vanished for good during a wartime reconnaissance mission in 1944. Written a year later but unpublished until 2000, when it became a bestseller in France, Consuelo's portrait reveals a Saint-Exup�ry far more human than the tragic, mythical hero constructed by his worshipful countrymen. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"We find in these pages all the tenderness and patience, but also the tenacity, of a woman who loves. Consuelo does not seek to explain or even to understand her husband, she accepts him and leads him to what he must be....Written with a strong and authentic voice, <b>The Tale of the Rose</b> is a book to read for its strength of character, and for the adventure that it offers."<br>&#x2014;<i>Elle</i><br><br>"Pioneering aviator, bestselling writer and romantic idol, Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry enjoyed a celebrity in his lifetime that was surpassed only by his fame after death....Now, Consuelo's side of the story of their stormy thirteen-year marriage has at last become known.

She bewitches with her voice.Throughout her account of her life with Tonio, as she called him, we hear this fairylike, enchanting voice."<br>&#x2014;<i>Paris Match</i><br><br>"A great love story that unfolds under thundering skies....We are drawn into a tale full of drama and flair, where the dazzle of the high life is entwined with a tender and tragic hymn to mad, passionate love....It is the greatest love story of the year.

Equal parts federal prison, treatment center, farm, and research laboratory, the Farm was designed to rehabilitate addicts and help researchers discover a cure for drug addiction. Although it began as a bold and ambitious public works project, and became famous as a rehabilitation center frequented by great jazz musicians among others, the Farm was shut down forty years after it opened amid scandal over its drug-testing program, which involved experiments where inmates were being used as human guinea pigs and rewarded with heroin and cocaine for their efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Published to coincide with a documentary to be aired on PBS, <i>The Narcotic Farm</i> includes rare and unpublished photographs, film stills, newspaper and magazine clippings, government documents, as well as interviews, writings, and anecdotes from the prisoners, doctors, and guards that trace the Farm&#x2019;s noble rise and tumultuous fall, revealing the compelling story of what really happened inside the prison walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><i>The Narcotic Farm </i>is a beautiful, fascinating book that takes readers deep into a forgotten American institution.

Or do you sense a hovering anxiety or uncertainty, an underlying unease that makes you feel just a bit uncomfortable, a bit distracted and disconnected from those around you?<br> In <i>The Road Home</i>, Ethan Nichtern, a senior teacher in the Shambhala Buddhist tradition, investigates the journey each of us takes to find where we belong. Drawing from contemporary research on meditation and mindfulness and his experience as a Buddhist teacher and practitioner, Nichtern describes in fresh and deeply resonant terms the basic existential experience that gives rise to spiritual seeking&#x2015;and also to its potentially dangerous counterpart, spiritual materialism. He reveals how our individual quests for self-awareness ripple forward into relationships, communities, and society at large. And he explains exactly how, by turning our awareness to what's happening around us and inside us, we become able to enhance our sense of connection with others and, at the same time, change for the better our individual and collective patterns of greed, apathy, and inattention.<br> In this wise and witty invitation to Buddhist meditation, Nichtern shows how, in order to create a truly compassionate and enlightened society, we must start with ourselves. And this means beginning by working with our own minds&#x2015;in whatever state we find them in.</p></p><p><b>Ethan Nichtern</b> is a senior teacher in the Shambhala Buddhist tradition and the author of <i>One City: A Declaration of Interdependence</i>.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. </p> <p>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard. </p><p>There were several promising-looking letters in the pile laid on Mrs James Kane's virgin breakfast-plate on Monday morning, but, having sorted all the envelopes with the air of one expectant of discovering treasure-trove, she extracted two addressed to her in hands indicative either of illiteracy or of extreme youth. One was tastefully inscribed in red ink; the other appeared to have been written with a crossed nib trailing a hair. Both were addressed to Mr and Mrs James Kane, but the incorporation of her husband's style with her Own Mrs Kane very properly ignored.</p> <p>Both missives would undoubtedly open with the formula: <em>Dear Mummy and Daddy, </em>but any share in their contents to which Mr James Kane could lay claim would be indicated by the words: '<em>Tell Daddy</em>'. Such information as was conveyed under this heading would be of a sporting nature. Urgent needs, ranging from money for the defraying of unforeseen and inescapable expenses to the instant forwarding of possessions only to be found after several days of intensive and exhausting search, would be addressed, with rare prescience, to Mummy.</p> <p>So it had been since the grim day of Master Silas James Kane's departure, at the age of eight, to his preparatory school in the West; so it was on this Monday morning in February, although Master Silas Kane was beginning to take more than an aloof interest in such trials of knowledge as the Common Entrance Examination; and his junior, Master Adrian Timothy Kane, had been for several terms pleasurably employed in upholding the tradition set for him at St Cyprian's of throwing himself wholeheartedly into all the more violent athletic pursuits, baiting unpopular masters, and doing as little work as was compatible with physical comfort. Had she been asked to do so, Mrs James Kane could have supplied the enquirer with a very fair paraphrase of either of her elder sons' letters, but this circumstance in no way detracted from the avidity with which she searched through Monday's post, or the satisfaction with which she perused the two documents that made Monday a red-letter day.</p> <p>Neither contributed much to her knowledge of her offspring's mental or physical well-being. An anxious question addressed to Master Adrian on the subject of an unidentified pain which might, or might not, turn out to be a grumbling appendix had been left unanswered, together with an urgent command to Master Silas to <em>Find out from Mr Kentmere when half-term will be so that Daddy and I can make arrangements to come down</em>. Both young gentlemen would have been much distressed by a failure on the part of their parents to put in an appearance at this function, but thus early in the term their minds were preoccupied with more pressing matters, chief amongst which was the need to replace the bath-sponge of one Bolton-Bagby, '<em>which</em>', wrote Master Adrian Kane, '<em>got chucked out of the window of Big Dorm</em>.'</p> <p>Mr James Kane, regaled with this passage, grinned, and said: 'Young devil! What's Silas got to say?'</p> <p>Mrs James Kane, in loving accents, read aloud the letter from her first-born. It opened with a pious hope that his parents were enjoying good health; adjured her to tell Daddy that '<em>we had a match against St Stephen's, we won 15-nil, they were punk</em>'; requested the instant despatch of an envelope containing such examples of the stamp-engraver's art as were known to him as 'my swops'; and informed his mother that owing to the thievish habits of some person or persons unknown a new pair of fives-gloves was urgently required. A disarming bracket added the words: <em>if you can manage it </em>; and a postscript conveyed kindly words of encouragement to his sister Susan, and his infant-brother William.</p> <p>'So <em>they're </em>all right!' said Mrs Kane, restoring both these interesting communications to their envelopes.</p> <p>Mr Kane did not ask her on what grounds she based this pronouncement. Since his post had contained a demand from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue which anyone less well-acquainted with this body of persons might have supposed to have been an infelicitous essay in broad humour, his son's request for new fives-gloves fell on hostile ears. He delivered himself of a strongly-worded condemnation of his wife's foolish practice of bringing up her children in the belief that their father was a millionaire. When she grew tired of listening to him, Mrs Kane said simply: 'All right, I'll tell him he can't have them.</p></p><h2>Dance at Grandpa&#39;s: Adapted from the Little House Books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (My First Little House Picture Books)</h2><p>A young pioneer girl and her family attend a wintertime party at her grandparents&#39; house</p><p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder was born in 1867 in the log cabin described in <i>Little House in the Big Woods.</i> As her classic Little House books tell us, she and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest.

She has been a journalist since 1984, working first for Reuters news agency and then for national newspapers in Britain, including the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and <i>The Independent</i>. Since 1999 she has been based in Sydney as <i>The Independent</i>&#x2019;s Asia-Pacific Correspondent, reporting from Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, East Timor, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, and the South Pacific. She has covered major stories around the region, including the post-independence violence in East Timor in 1999, the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings, the civil war in Indonesia&#x2019;s Aceh province, the Indian Ocean Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 and the 2006 Java earthquake. In 2004 she was one of six international journalists who travelled to Pitcairn Island for the child sex abuse trials.<b>Prologue</b><p>Pitcairn Island, a British outpost floating in a remote corner of the South Pacific, was until recently considered a tropical paradise. Seldom visited, it is a place of extreme isolation, with no airstrip and limited sea access. The rocky outcrop is inhabited by about fifty people, most of them descended from Fletcher Christian and his fellow HMAV <i>Bounty</i> mutineers.</p><p>The sailors fled to the island to evade British law, but for the next two centuries Pitcairn was, to all appearances, trouble free -- stabilized by religion, with negligible crime, and largely capable of running its own affairs. Just before the dawn of the new millennium, that perception was turned on its head.</p><p>In December 1999, several Pitcairn girls claimed that they had been sexually assaulted by a visiting New Zealander. By chance, a British policewoman was on the island, and one of the girls confided that she had also been raped by two local men in the past. An investigation into those allegations developed into a major inquiry that saw British detectives crisscross the globe, interviewing dozens of Pitcairn women. Their conclusion was that nearly every girl growing up on the island in the last forty years had been abused, and nearly every man had been an offender.</p><p>I first read about the investigation -- codenamed, quite coincidentally, Operation Unique -- in 2000, when snippets surfaced in the British and New Zealand media. At that time, I was a relative newcomer to Sydney, where I am based as Asia-Pacific correspondent for the <i>Independent,</i> the British national newspaper. The story had immediate appeal, combining Pitcairn's mutinous history with a glimpse of life darkly played out on a far-flung island -- an island that also happened to be a British colony, one of the final vestiges of Empire.</p><p>What struck me, even at that early stage, was that sexual abuse seemed to have been part of the fabric of life on Pitcairn. I tried to visualize what childhood must have been like for the victims, living there with no means of escape from their assailants.</p><p>At the same time, certain Pitcairners -- including women on the island -- were loudly denying that children had ever been mistreated. They claimed that Pitcairn was a laid-back Polynesian society where girls matured early and were willing sexual partners. Britain, they claimed, was trying to cripple the community and force it to close, thus ridding itself of a costly burden. Who was telling the truth, I wondered: the women describing their experiences of abuse, or those portraying the affair as a British conspiracy?</p><p>For Britain, the case raised embarrassing questions about its supervision of the colony, now known as an overseas territory. Confronted with such serious allegations, however, the government had no choice but to act robustly. Judges and lawyers were appointed, and in 2003, after a series of legal and logistical hurdles had been surmounted, 13 men were charged with 96 offences dating back to the 1960s.</p><p>The plan was to conduct two sets of trials: the first on Pitcairn, the second in New Zealand. Preparations got under way on the island, where the accused men helped to build their own prison. The locals wanted the press excluded; as a compromise, and to prevent the place from being swamped, Britain decided to accredit just six journalists. News organizations around the world were invited to make a pitch.</p><p>On holiday in Japan at the time, I submitted a rather hurried application, pointing out my long-standing interest in the story. I also mentioned that I would be able to file for the <i>Independent's</i> sister paper, the <i>New Zealand Herald.</i> Shortly afterward, I was informed that I had been chosen as a member of the media pool.</p><p>In 2004, I spent six weeks on the island, reporting on one of the most bizarre court cases imaginable. Outside court, I bumped into the main protagonists every day, which was inevitable, since I was living in the middle of their tiny community. Some of those encounters were civil, others were less so, but I was able to observe at close quarters how Pitcairn functioned: the gossip, the feuding, the claustrophobic intimacy -- and the power dynamics that had allowed the abuse to flourish.</p><p>The legal saga did not end with the verdicts and sentences handed down on the island by visiting judges. It continued until late 2007, with further trials held in Auckland and the offenders appealing to every court up to the Privy Council in London. As I followed these twists and turns in both hemispheres, my mind buzzed with unanswered questions.</p><p>Why was it that many outsiders persisted in defending men who were guilty of a crime that was normally reviled -- pedophilia? Why did they continue to mythologize Pitcairn, although it had failed, in such a dramatic way, to live up to its utopian image? How far back, I asked myself, did the sexual abuse stretch -- to the time of the mutineers? Why had parents not denounced the perpetrators and kept their children safe? Had anyone outside the island realized what was going on?</p><p>There were bigger questions, too. What did Pitcairn tell us about human nature and life in small, remote communities? Is this how all of us would behave if left to ourselves, with no one looking over our shoulder?</p><p>Is Pitcairn a cautionary tale, a real-life version of <i>Lord of the Flies,</i> that chilling story of a group of schoolboys who descend into savagery on an imaginary island?</p><p>Are there more Pitcairns out there?</p><p>Copyright � 2009 by Kathy Marks</p></p><h2>Be You.

With his trademark wit and distinctive voice, Bouton recounts his battle against the local power elite, who wanted to build a new stadium to replace Wahconah Park, a project the citizens had voted against three different times.But Foul Ball is more than a hilarious romp about saving an old ballpark. In a detailed diary-his first since Ball Four-Bouton takes us along on his wild ride, into the teeth of corporate malfeasance, anti-democratic process, the tyranny of a one-newspaper town, and the real reason why the good old boys wanted to build a new stadium.</p><p>Jim Bouton was a major league pitcher for the New York Yankees, Seattle Pilots, Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves. His book, Ball Four, was entered into evidence at the decisive arbitration hearing that led to free-agency in baseball, and the New York Public Library included it as one of its Books of the Century.Bouton has been raising hell with the baseball establishment since 1970, when his landmark <i>Ball Four</i> revealed the frat-party side of the grand old game. Now he lines up against the economic lynchpin of pro sports: publicly funded stadiums. Pittsfield, Massachusetts, is the site of venerable Wahconah Park, home to various minor-league teams since 1892. Bouton and most of the area's citizenry feel the stadium should be repaired, updated, and preserved. The city government, however, along with various business interests, wants to build a new $18 million stadium--at taxpayer expense. This relatively small skirmish is portrayed by Bouton as a microcosm of the publicly funded sports facility battles that have been fought around the country. Typically, taxpayers foot the bill--under the pressure of team abandonment--so owners and players can get rich. Bouton, humor intact and sense of irony sharpened, chronicles the battle between the forces of fiscal responsibility and those who would build the new stadium (on a toxic waste dump). The good guys win this time, as the old ballpark is saved, at least temporarily, but Bouton paints a distinctly disturbing picture of corporate greed and taxpayer exploitation. Interestingly, Bouton's original publisher pulled out under pressure from pro-stadium business interests, leaving the author to publish his expose himself. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although her father, who worked for the Coast Guard, visited regularly, the girl and her mother were the island's only human inhabitants. But they shared this isolated piece of land with 10 wild horses, who "flew across the sand like windblown seeds and their dark hooves splashed stars from the sea." When the snow covered up the horses' grazing ground, the hungry animals appeared at the girl's house, where they were given bread, carrots and even straw from the youngster's own bed. The girl and her family ultimately moved on to live elsewhere, but she never forgot this very special place and its wild horses--her friends.

With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>The Whelping and Rearing of Puppies: A Complete and Practical Guide</h2><p>The Whelping and Rearing Puppies: A Complete and Practical Guide</p><p></p><h2>The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity</h2><p><p>In his monumental book Peter Brown addresses the practice of permanent sexual renunciation--continence, celibacy, and life-long virginity--that developed in Christian circles from the first to the fifth centuries A.D. </p><p>Brown vividly describes the early Christians and their strange, disturbing preoccupations.

Francis Herreshoff created some great yacht designs. His designs are marked by clean, sweeping lines and a simplicity of hull and rig that show that they have been drawn by a true artist. In each design, he strips away every non-essential and leaves the true elements of a masterpiece. His father, Nathanael G. Herreshoff, had the same genius, but whereas the work of the father emphasized engineering perfection, the work of the son emphasized artistic perfection. </p><p>Francis Herreshoff's work certainly shows the influence of his father, but his designs are tempered with an even older tradition. One of Captain Nat's famous designs was the little Buzzards Bay 12 1/2-footer, which may be examined in the plans at the back of this book in the form of Francis Herreshoff's slightly enlarged copy, the Buzzards Bay 14-footer. It is interesting to note the influence of this design on L. Francis' well-known cruising ketch, the H-28. But the schooner yacht <i>America</i>, which came out decades before Captain Nat began designing yachts, also had considerable influence on several famous Francis Herreshoff designs, such as the <i>Tioga II</i>, now <i>Ticonderoga</i>. And L. Francis was obviously intrigued with the possibilities of the double-ender, an ancient form of hull. </p><p>The primary designs in this book are based on L. Francis Herreshoff's series of articles in the <i>Rudder</i> magazine of the 1940's and 1950's detailing how to build many of his designs. It was a very popular series, and a considerable number of boats were built according to the plans and instructions L. Francis included. We have added to these design plans for 46 additional small craft and cruising yachts designed by L. Francis. </p><p>It is our hope that his book will lead to the building of more and more boats from the designs of L. Francis Herreshoff. There could be no more fitting tribute to him.</p></p><p>``We Herreshoff disciples--and we are legion--have savored each succinct phrase, every wry comment on the foibles of less chaste boats and boatmen.

When he was just thirteen years old, Henry ran across a man painting in a Philadelphia park. Inspired to paint himself, Henry was given enough money to buy some brushes and pigments by his mother--and so his adventure began. &nbsp;Henry Ossawa Tanner was no ordinary young man. He was born in 1859, just two years before the Civil War began. His middle name, Ossawa, was taken from the town of Osawatomie in Kansas, the site of an anti-slavery raid. The oldest of seven children, Henry graduated from one of the few secondary schools for Black people in Philadelphia before studying under Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Later he went to France, where he had heard Black artists were accepted without prejudice. Indeed, not only were his paintings exhibited every year in the Paris Salon but in 1923, he was made a chevalier of the Order of the Legion of Honor, France's highest award for an artist. &nbsp;Henry Ossawa Tanner: His Boyhood Dreams Come True is Faith Ringgold's fifteenth book for children.

These games between Yamamoto and Watanabe usually came to an end after Yamamoto had won four times in succession, but very occasionally Watanabe instead would win several games in a row. This invariably happened when a low-pressure front was approaching; possibly Yamamoto was the type that is allergic to changes in the weather. That particular evening, however, it was fine, and Yamamoto won. They finished playing rather earlier than usual, then Yamamoto and his staff officers bathed and retired temporarily to their own cabins. <p>Some of them slept for two or three hours, others could not sleep at all, but not long after midnight most of the staff officers were once again assembled in small groups in the operations room. The officer on duty was air "B" staff officer Sasaki Akira. </p> <p>The four walls of the operations room were plastered with large maps of the entire Pacific area and charts of various zones of Southeast Asian waters. On the table were a large globe and still more charts, and on a smaller table files of operational orders and radio messages. </p> <p>Yamamoto was sitting quite still, eyes shut, in a folding chair in front of the big table at the back. </p> <p>News came in of the army's landing at Kota Bharu, then of the successful landing at Bataan in the Philippines. There followed a long and trying period of waiting. Time seemed to drag interminably. An uneasy silence prevailed in the operations room. No one spoke; the only sounds were the rustle of messages being flipped over in their files and the occasional scratching of a pencil. </p> <p>Across the passage lay the radio room, from which a cord led to a receiver standing on the table in the operations room, so that those present could hear directly any messages that came in. Eventually, senior staff officer Kuroshima said in a quiet voice, "It should begin any moment now." </p> <p>He glanced up at the clock on the bulkhead, and a stir ran through the room. At that moment, the radio operator came running in and shouted at the staff officer on duty: "Sir--the repeated to signal." </p> <p>Sasaki turned to the commander in chief. "As you hear, sir," he reported. "The message was sent at 0319 hours." </p> <p>Yamamoto opened his eyes wide and nodded. His mouth turned down grimly at the corners. "Did you get that message direct from the plane?" he asked the operator. The Nagato's radio room had, in fact, received the "to, to, to, to..." direct from the skies over Oahu. </p> <p>"Direct reception?" said Ugaki. "Good work!" The young operator looked pleased, saluted, and rushed out of the room again. </p> <p>There followed a succession of reports from the attacking units: </p> <p>"Surprise attack successful." </p> <p>"Enemy warships torpedoed; outstanding results." </p> <p>"Hickam Field attacked; outstanding results." </p> <p>At the same time, the radio in the operations room was picking up directly a great number of uncoded radio messages from the American side. From what Ugaki says in his Sensoroku, the messages tended to be broken and jerky: "SOS--attacked by Jap bombers here...." or "Oahu attacked by Jap dive-bombers from carrier...." When Yamamoto heard one of them--"Jap!--this is the real thing"--a brief grin seemed to pass over his face. </p> <p>Exactly one hour after the first assault, the second attack force led by Lieutenant Commander Shimazaki Shigekazu, 170 planes in all, swept into the skies over Pearl Harbor and also achieved considerable results before withdrawing. By the time dawn broke over Hiroshima Bay, the number of messages being received in the operations room of the Nagato was dwindling steadily. </p> <p>From any point of view, the raid had been an outstanding success, and the staff officers could not conceal their jubilation; Yamamoto alone, apparently, remained sunk in apparent depression.</p></p><h2>Gig Posters Volume I: Rock Show Art of the 21st Century</h2><p>The Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Dance, Folk, Metal, Electronic, Indie Music Spectacular<br> &nbsp;<br> Here are more than 700 extraordinary posters from the archives of GigPosters.com&#x2014;the Internet&#x2019;s premier destination for concert poster art.

In this extraordinary memoir, Fuchsia recalls her evolving relationship with China and its food, from her first rapturous encounter with the delicious cuisine of Sichuan Province to brushes with corruption, environmental degradation, and greed. In the course of her fascinating journey, Fuchsia undergoes an apprenticeship at China's premier Sichuan cooking school, where she is the only foreign student in a class of nearly fifty young Chinese men; attempts, hilariously, to persuade Chinese people that "Western food" is neither "simple" nor "bland"; and samples a multitude of exotic ingredients, including sea cucumber, civet cat, scorpion, rabbit-heads, and the ovarian fat of the snow frog. But is it possible for a Westerner to become a true convert to the Chinese way of eating? In an encounter with a caterpillar in an Oxford kitchen, Fuchsia is forced to put this to the test.From the vibrant markets of Sichuan to the bleached landscape of northern Gansu Province, from the desert oases of Xinjiang to the enchanting old city of Yangzhou, this unique and evocative account of Chinese culinary culture is set to become the most talked-about travel narrative of the year.</p><p>Literary, entertaining and almost anthropological.Fuchsia Dunlop has appeared on NPR&#x2019;s &#x201c;All Things Considered,&#x201d; &#x201c;Science Friday,&#x201d; and &#x201c;America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen Radio,&#x201d; and is a regular contributor to publications including the Financial Times, Saveur, the Wall Street Journal, Lucky Peach, and The New Yorker.

Personalities such as Elvis Presley, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Jordan are more recognizable to many people than are most elected officials. <i>With Amusement for All</i> is the first comprehensive history of two centuries of mass entertainment in the United States, covering everything from the penny press to Playboy, the NBA to NASCAR, big band to hip hop, and other topics including film, comics, television, sports, dance, and music. Paying careful attention to matters of race, gender, class, technology, economics, and politics, LeRoy Ashby emphasizes the complex ways in which popular culture simultaneously reflects and transforms American culture, revealing that the world of entertainment constantly evolves as it tries to meet the demands of a diverse audience. Trends in popular entertainment often reveal the tensions between competing ideologies, appetites, and values in American society. For example, in the late nineteenth century, Americans embraced "self-made men" such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie: the celebrities of the day were circus tycoons P.T. Barnum and James A. Bailey, Wild West star "Buffalo Bill" Cody, professional baseball organizer Albert Spalding, and prizefighter John L. Sullivan. At the same time, however, several female performers challenged traditional notions of weak, frail Victorian women. Adah Isaacs Menken astonished crowds by wearing tights that made her appear nude while performing dangerous stunts on horseback, and the shows of the voluptuous burlesque group British Blondes often centered on provocative images of female sexual power and dominance. Ashby describes how history and politics frequently influence mainstream entertainment. When Native Americans, blacks, and other non-whites appeared in the nineteenth-century circuses and Wild West shows, it was often to perpetuate demeaning racial stereotypes&#x2015;crowds jeered Sitting Bull at Cody's shows. By the early twentieth century, however, black minstrel acts reveled in racial tensions, reinforcing stereotypes while at the same time satirizing them and mocking racist attitudes before a predominantly white audience. Decades later, Red Foxx and Richard Pryor's profane comedy routines changed American entertainment. The raw ethnic material of Pryor's short-lived television show led to a series of African-American sitcoms in the 1980s that presented common American experiences&#x2015;from family life to college life&#x2015;with black casts. Mainstream entertainment has often co-opted and sanitized fringe amusements in an ongoing process of redefining the cultural center and its boundaries. Social control and respectability vied with the bold, erotic, sensational, and surprising, as entrepreneurs sought to manipulate the vagaries of the market, control shifting public appetites, and capitalize on campaigns to protect public morals. Rock 'n Roll was one such fringe culture; in the 1950s, Elvis blurred gender norms with his androgynous style and challenged conventions of public decency with his sexually-charged performances. By the end of the 1960s, Bob Dylan introduced the social consciousness of folk music into the rock scene, and The Beatles embraced hippie counter-culture. Don McLean's 1971 anthem "American Pie" served as an epitaph for rock's political core, which had been replaced by the spectacle of hard rock acts such as Kiss and Alice Cooper. While Rock 'n Roll did not lose its ability to shock, in less than three decades it became part of the established order that it had originally sought to challenge. With Amusement for All provides the context to what Americans have done for fun since 1830, showing the reciprocal nature of the relationships between social, political, economic, and cultural forces and the way in which the entertainment world has reflected, refracted, or reinforced the values those forces represent in America.</p><p><b>LeRoy Ashby</b> is Regents Professor and Claudius O. and Mary Johnson Distinguished Professor of History at Washington State University.

Huntington. According to the journal&#39;s editors it went on to generate more discussion than anything they had published since the Second World War. In the article, Huntington posed the question whether conflicts between civilizations would dominate the future of world politics. In the book, he gives the answer, showing not only how clashes between civilizations are the greatest threat to world peace but also how an international order based on civilizations is the best safeguard against war. Since September 11, his thesis has seemed even more prescient and acute. THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS AND THE REMAKING OF WORLD ORDER is now recognised as a classic study of international relations in an increasingly uncertain world.</p><p>The thesis of the provocative and potentially important <i>Clash of Civilizations</i> is that the increasing threat of violence arising from renewed conflicts between countries and cultures that base their traditions on religious faith and dogma. This argument moves past the notion of ethnicity to examine the growing influence of a handful of major cultures--Western, Eastern Orthodox, Latin American, Islamic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu and African--in current struggles across the globe. Samuel P Huntington, a political scientist at Harvard University and foreign policy aide to President Clinton, argues that policymakers should be mindful of this development when they interfere in other nations' affairs. --<i>Christine Buttery</i>&#34;One of the most important books to have emerged since the end of the Cold War&#34; Henry Kissinger; &#34;The book is dazzling in its scope and grasp of the intricacies of contemporary global politics&#34; Francis Fukuyama; &#34;An intellectual tour de force: bold, imaginative, and provocative.

Includes activities.</p><p>Kerry A. Graves is a Capstone Press author.Reviewed with Rachel Koestler's <i>Going to School during the Civil Rights Movement</i>. <p>Gr. 4-6. Looking at childhood is a good way to study the history of ordinary people, and this new Going to School in History series will show students what daily life was once like for kids. Both books frame the school facts with a general overview of the time and then focus on the classroom. <i>Pioneer Times</i> makes the old mistake of talking about an open, "unsettled" country, with no mention of the Native Americans who were driven out of sight. But, otherwise, it is a good introduction both to pioneer life on the western frontier and to the goings-on in a one-room schoolhouse. <i>Civil Rights</i> is much more political. Framed by the history of segregation and the protest movement that changed it, the classroom story is a stirring close-up of the separate, unequal schools and the brave young people who fought against them. Moving sepia-tone photos appear on every page. Sidebars and special features, including craft activities and brief biographies, add both facts and fun.

You saw only a part of me. After I retired from boxing my true work began. I have embarked on a journey of love."</i> <p> So Muhammad Ali begins this spiritual memoir, his description of the values that have shaped and sustained him and that continue to guide his life. In <i>The Soul of a Butterfly</i> the great champion takes readers on a spiritual journey through the seasons of life, from childhood to the present, and shares the beliefs that have served him well. </p><p> After fighting some of the fiercest bouts in boxing history against Joe Frazier and George Foreman, today Muhammad Ali faces his most powerful foe -- outside the boxing ring. Like many people, he battles an illness that limits his physical abilities, but as he says, "I have gained more than I have lost....I have never had a more powerful voice than I have now." Ali reflects on his faith in God and the strength it gave him during his greatest challenge, when he lost the prime years of his boxing career because he would not compromise his beliefs. He describes how his study of true Islam has helped him accept the changes in his life and has brought him to a greater awareness of life's true purpose. As a United Nations "Messenger of Peace," he has traveled widely, and he describes his 2002 mission to Afghanistan to heighten public awareness of that country's desperate situation, as well as his more recent meeting with the Dalai Lama. </p><p> Ali's reflections on topics ranging from moral courage to belief in God to respect for those who differ from us will inspire and enlighten all who read them. Written with the assistance of his daughter Hana, <i>The Soul of a Butterfly</i> is a compassionate and heartfelt book that will provide comfort for our troubled times.</p></p><p><b>Muhammad Ali</b> is the former three-time world heavyweight boxing champion. He and his wife, Lonnie, have established the Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, to preserve and share the legacy and ideals of Muhammad Ali. <b>Hana Ali</b> is a writer. She lives in Michigan, near her father and stepmother.<b>The Foundation of Life</b> <p> I can remember, when I was just a kid in Louisville, Kentucky, my mother would wake my brother and me early every Sunday morning. She would come into our room, kiss us on the forehead, and say in a gentle whisper, "Wake up, tinky baby, wake up, Rudy, we're going to thank the Lord!" </p><p> My mother would sometimes call me "GG," too, because those were the first syllables I had spoken. After I won the Gold Gloves, I told her that from the very beginning I was trying to say "Golden Gloves." I thought my mother had a tiny little bird nose. I don't know why I thought that, because birds don't have noses, but from the moment I said it we all started calling her Mama Bird. After waking me and Rudy, Bird would cook us a nice breakfast. While we ate, she would iron our best clothes and lay them out on the bed. Then she would call us for a bath. After getting dressed, Rudy and I would go outside to sit on the front porch and shoot marbles before we headed off for Sunday school. </p><p> I can remember trying hard not to get dirty. I knew I looked handsome in my freshly ironed shirt and bow tie. When Bird walked out beside my father, Cassius Clay, or Cash, I remember looking up at them with pride, thinking how pretty she looked and how handsome he was with his thick black mustache. Cash would often say to me, "Most men envy me because they can't grow a mustache as long and thick as mine." </p><p> What he said has always stuck with me. I think that to him, his mustache was a source of pride. To this day, every so often, I let my own grow. </p><p> I had a strong foundation growing up; my parents were loving, affectionate people. Ever since I can remember, my father was always hugging and kissing us. He would say "give me those jaws" (his term for kissing our cheeks). Then he kissed us until our cheeks turned red. Cash always made me feel important. Although, at times my father had a quick temper, and my parents had disagreements, I had a happy home life and I knew that I was loved. My parents made me feel special. When it wasn't my father's affection, it was my mother's stories. Mama Bird was always telling me about the time I was born. She said that I was such a pretty baby, everyone thought I was a girl, and that from the moment they brought me home, Cash was "biting my jaws." My parents weren't perfect, but they each had a loving nature. My father was a painter. He made his living painting murals and signs. Almost every Baptist church around Louisville has his work in them. My father was very talented; I have one of his paintings hanging on my office wall, right above my desk. Cash used to tell people that he wasn't just a painter; he was an artist. Sometimes he would take me and Rudy to work with him. Cash would teach us how to mix the paint and lay out a sign. I could draw a little, but nothing special. It was Rudy that took after Cash. He is an artist, too. Cash used to say that if it weren't for the way things were then, a lot more people would have known what he could do. My father raised us well. He made sure we were surrounded by good people, taught us to always confront the things we feared, and to try to be the best at whatever we did. After delivering his advice, Cash would say, "These are the things my father said to me, and you don't learn them by accident, they have to be taught." </p><p> Cash was one of a kind; he was full of life and energy. He loved hugging, kissing, talking, and debating. He was my father and my friend. He was at my side when he could be and we had a lot more good times together than bad. </p><p> Sometimes, after school, when we finished our homework, Rudy and I would play outside with some of the other kids in the neighborhood. I used to ask Rudy to throw rocks at me to see if he could hit me. He thought that I was crazy, but no matter how many he threw, he could never hit me. I was too fast. I was running left, and right, ducking, dodging, and jumping out of the way. My brother and I had a lot of fun together, we never really got into fights. My mother used to tell me that when I was about four, whenever she would try to discipline Rudy, I would step in and say, "Don't you spank my baby." Rudy and I have always been close. He's my younger brother and I love him. </p><p> I wasn't much trouble as a child, but when I did cut up, Mama Bird just sat me in a corner and put an old bear head rug in the middle of the floor. I was so scared of it, I didn't move an inch. I thought the rug might jump up and bite me. My mother was a gentle lady. She always spoke in a tender voice and I never heard her say a bad thing about anyone. She didn't gossip or meddle in other people's business. She taught us that prejudice was wrong, and to always treat people with love and respect. My mother loved to cook, eat, make clothes, and be with her family. I loved her very much; there's never been anyone better to me in my whole life. </p><p> I learned a lot from my parents while I was growing up. I noticed how they remained dignified in the face of injustice. I saw how they responded to the people around them; I witnessed how my mother would forgive, not hate. And how Cash always held his head high and he worked hard. Growing up, we were poor in terms of money, but we were rich to have had so much love and pride in our household. We were raised with strong values and learned the importance of integrity and compassion. More important than the words, I learned by their example. </p><p> My mother was a Baptist and my father was a Methodist, but we always went to my mother's church. She taught us everything she believed was true about God. Cash used to say that he let Mama Bird raise us her way, because she was a good Baptist, and that a woman is better than a man, so we should follow our mother. </p><p> When I was in junior high school I applied for a job cleaning the blackboards and desks and doing odd jobs at Spalding College in Louisville. Sister James Ella gave me the job. I made a few dollars a week, working under the direction of Sister Ann. Sister James Ella was a sweet lady. She showed me how to clean shelves and sweep the floor. She passed away a few years ago, but I will always remember her. I had a good childhood. There were obstacles, and hardships, but I remained on the straight path. I kept my values in mind, and my faith remained strong. Although my religion would change later in my life, God was always in my heart. </p><p> My mother once told me that my confidence in myself made her believe in me. I thought that was funny, because it was her confidence in me that strengthened my belief in myself. I didn't realize it then, but from the very beginning, my parents were helping me build the foundation for my life. </p><p>Copyright � 2004 by Muhammad Ali Family Trust </p><p> When we arrived at the club, everyone took a seat and enjoyed the music. People were always shocked when they found out that I couldn't dance. But it was true; outside the ring my feet would lose their rhythm and grace, and they wouldn't move to the tune. Regardless, I have always enjoyed listening to good music and, every now and again, I would get up and dance anyway. </p><p> I didn't get a chance to meet Sugar Ray that night, but I remember the address of his club like I was reading it from the outside of the building now. </p><p> As we were leaving, I noticed a man standing on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 125th Street. He stood out because he was holding up a sign that said "buy black." I had never seen any Black man in Louisville do something as bold as that. </p><p> Before we left for Italy I tried again to meet Sugar Ray. I walked all the way up Fifth Avenue to 125th Street. I wanted to get his autograph and tell him that I was on my way to the Olympics to win a gold medal. I wanted to tell him that I admired him, and that I was going to be the heavyweight champion of the world by the time I was twenty-one. When I arrived at the club I waited outside all day for Sugar Ray to get there. I didn't mind waiting; I would have stood outside all week if I had to. </p><p> It was about ten o'clock when he finally drove up. I was so excited that for the first time in my life, I was speechless. When I pulled myself together, I walked up to Mr. Robinson and told him how far I had come just to see him and how long I had been waiting to get his autograph. I told him that I was going to be the heavyweight champion of the whole world, and that he was my hero. </p><p> When I think back, I realize he never really looked at me. He gave me a quick pat on the shoulder and told me, "Later, boy, I'm busy right now." I was crushed. I couldn't believe he brushed me aside like that, especially after I had waited all day for him to show up. I felt as if my feet were made of cement. I couldn't move. I just stood there as I watched Sugar Ray Robinson turn his back to me and walk away. Although I felt hurt and let down, I decided that I wouldn't let my disappointment get the best of me. </p><p> I was going to be different when I became a great boxer. I would be the kind of champion that fans could walk up to and talk to. I would shake their hands and sign every autograph, even sign some autographs in advance so that when I was in a hurry, I could still hand them out to people, assuring everyone went home happy. </p><p> I was going to go out of my way to show my fans how important they were, and how much I appreciated them. </p><p> At that moment, I vowed never to turn a fan away. </p><p> I didn't want anyone to feel the disappointment and hurt that I felt that night. I was always going to make time for the people who looked up to me; especially children. I knew that when I became a champion -- and I knew that I would -- I was going to remember what it was like before I made it big. I wasn't going to forget where I came from. </p><p> I was going to be my own kind of champion, a champ to all people everywhere in the world. And no matter how high I climbed up the ladder of success, I was going to view the world without looking down on anyone. And I wasn't going to forget the boy that I once was. </p><p> I had a golden vision, but before any of it could happen, I had to win at the Olympics. </p><p> On th...</p></p><h2>Botero</h2><p><strong>Pleasantly plump</strong> &nbsp; With whimsical irony and a style reminiscent of the old masters, Fernando Botero (b.1932) began painting caricatured animals and corpulent bodies with disproportionate heads at a time when his contemporaries were fervently rejecting figurative work in favor of abstraction.

In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent, lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn. <b>The Lost Symbol</b> is exactly what Brown's fans have been waiting for . . . his most thrilling novel yet.</p></p><p>Let's start with the question every Dan Brown fan wants answered: Is <em>The Lost Symbol</em> as good as <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>? Simply put, yes. Brown has mastered the art of blending nail-biting suspense with random arcana (from pop science to religion), and <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is an enthralling mix. And what a dazzling accomplishment that is, considering that rabid fans and skeptics alike are scrutinizing every word. <em><br><br>The Lost Symbol</em> begins with an ancient ritual, a shadowy enclave, and of course, a secret. Readers know they are in Dan Brown territory when, by the end of the first chapter, a secret within a secret is revealed. To tell too much would ruin the fun of reading this delicious thriller, so you will find no spoilers here. Suffice it to say that as with many series featuring a recurring character, there is a bit of a formula at work (one that fans will love). Again, brilliant Harvard professor Robert Langdon finds himself in a predicament that requires his vast knowledge of symbology and superior problem-solving skills to save the day. The setting, unlike other Robert Langdon novels, is stateside, and in Brown's hands Washington D.C. is as fascinating as Paris or Vatican City (note to the D.C. tourism board: get your "Lost Symbol" tour in order). And, as with other Dan Brown books, the pace is relentless, the revelations many, and there is an endless parade of intriguing factoids that will make you feel like you are spending the afternoon with Robert Langdon and the guys from <em>Mythbusters</em>. <br><br>Nothing is as it seems in a Robert Langdon novel, and <em>The Lost Symbol</em> itself is no exception--a page-turner to be sure, but Brown also challenges his fans to open their minds to new information. Skeptical? Imagine how many other thrillers would spawn millions of Google searches for noetic science, superstring theory, and <em>Apotheosis of Washington</em>. <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is brain candy of the best sort--just make sure to set aside time to enjoy your meal. <em>--Daphne Durham</em> <br><br> <strong><br></strong><strong>More from Dan Brown</strong> <p></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></td> <td><em>Angels &amp; Demons</em></td> <td><em>Deception Point</em></td> <td><em>Digital Fortress</em></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br><p>Dan Brown is the author of <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> one of the most widely read novels of all time, as well as the international bestsellers <i>Angels &amp; Demons,</i> <i>Deception Point,</i> and <i>Digital Fortress</i>.

The other two weren&#x2019;t big enough. One was set in a trash container outside the convenience store at a forested place called Bailey&#x2019;s Corner, which was more or less in the middle of nowhere, so no one thought much about it. Some dumb practical joke with a sparkler after the Fourth of July, right? Then, when the second flamed up along the main highway, right at the edge of a struggling little farmers&#x2019; market, pretty much everyone decided that <i>that</i> one took off because an idiot had thrown a lit cigarette from his car window right in the middle of the driest season of the year.</p><p>But the third fire was different. Not only because it happened at the fairgrounds, which were just yards away from the middle school and less than a quarter mile from the village of Langley, but also because the flames began during the county fair when hundreds of people were milling around a midway.</p><p>A girl called Becca King was among them, along with her boyfriend and her best girl friend: Derric Mathieson and Jenn McDaniels. The three were a study in contrasts, with Becca light-haired, trim from months of bicycle riding, and wearing heavy-rimmed glasses and enough makeup to suggest she was auditioning for membership in the reincarnation of the rock band Kiss; Derric tall, well-built, shaven-headed, African, and gorgeous; and Jenn all sinew and attitude, hair cut like a boy&#x2019;s and tan from a summer of intense soccer practice. These three were sitting in the bleachers set back from an outdoor stage upon which a group called the Time Benders was about to begin performing.</p><p>It was Saturday night, the night that drew the most people to the fairgrounds because it was also the night when the entertainment was, as Jenn put it, &#x201c;marginally less suicide-inducing than the other days.&#x201d; Those other days the entertainment consisted of tap dancers, yodelers, magicians, fiddlers, and a one-man band. On Saturday night an Elvis impersonator and the Time Benders comprised what went for the highlight of the fair.</p><p>For Becca King, with a lifetime spent in San Diego and just short of one year in the Puget Sound area, the fair was like everything else she&#x2019;d discovered on Whidbey Island: something in miniature. The barn-red buildings were standard stuff, but their size was minuscule compared to the vast buildings she was used to at the Del Mar racetrack where the San Diego County Fair took place. This held true for the stables for horses, sheep, cattle, alpacas, and goats. It was doubly true for the performance ring where the dogs were shown and the horses were ridden. The food, however, was the same as it was at county fairs everywhere, and as the Time Benders readied themselves to take the stage after Elvis&#x2019;s final bow during which he nearly lost his wig, Becca and Derric and Jenn were chowing down on funnel cake and kettle corn.</p><p>The crowd, who turned up to watch the Time Benders every single year, was gearing up its excitement level for the performance. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the act would be the same as last August and the August before that and the one before that. The Time Benders were a real crowd pleaser in a place where the nearest mall was a ferry ride away and first-run movies were virtually unheard of. So a singing group who performed rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll through the ages by altering their wigs and their costumes and re-enacting the greatest hits of the 1950s onwards was akin to a mystical appearance by Kurt Cobain, especially if you had any imagination.</p><p>Jenn was grousing. Watching the Time Benders was bad enough, she was saying. Watching the Time Benders at the same time as being a third wheel on &#x201c;the Derric-and-Becca looove bike&#x201d; was even worse.</p><p>Becca smiled and ignored her. Jenn loved to grouse. She said, &#x201c;So who are these guys, anyway?&#x201d; in reference to the Time Benders as she dipped into the kettle corn and leaned comfortably against Derric&#x2019;s arm.</p><p>&#x201c;God. Who d&#x2019;you <i>think</i>?&#x201d; was Jenn&#x2019;s unhelpful reply. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;know how other county fairs have shows where has-been performers give their last gasp before they finally hang it up and retire? Well, what we got is <i>unknown</i> performers re-enacting the performances of has-been performers. Welcome to Whidbey. And would you <i>stop</i> feeling her up, Derric?&#x201d; she said to their companion.</p><p>&#x201c;Holding her hand isn&#x2019;t feeling her up,&#x201d; was the boy&#x2019;s easy reply. &#x201c;Now if you want to see some serious feeling up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d; He leered at Becca. She laughed and gave him a playful shove.</p><p>&#x201c;I <i>hate </i>this, you know,&#x201d; Jenn told her friend. She was returning to the previous third-wheel-on-the-looove-bike topic. &#x201c;I shoulda stayed home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lots of things come in threes,&#x201d; Becca said.</p><p>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tricycle wheels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Triplets,&#x201d; Derric said.</p><p>&#x201c;Those three-wheel baby buggies for joggers who need to take their kids with them,&#x201d; Becca added.</p><p>&#x201c;Birds have three toes,&#x201d; Derric pointed out. Then, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; he said to Becca.</p><p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d; Jenn reached for more funnel cake and jammed it into her mouth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a bird toe. Lemme send that out on Twitter.&#x201d;</p><p>Which would, of course, be the last thing Jenn McDaniels could have done, since among them Derric was the only one who possessed anything remotely close to technological. Jenn had neither computer nor iPhone nor iPad nor laptop, because her family was too poor for anything more than a third-hand color television the size of a Jeep, practically given away by the thrift store in town. As for Becca&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, there were a lot of reasons why Becca remained at a distance from technology and all of them had to do with keeping a profile so low that it was invisible.</p><p>The Time Benders came forth at this point, climbing onto the stage past amplifiers that looked like bank vaults. Their wigs, pegged pants, white socks, and poodle skirts indicated that&#x2014;just like last year&#x2014;they&#x2019;d be starting with the fifties. The Time Benders <i>never</i> worked in reverse.</p><p>The crowd cheered as the show began, lit by the rest of the midway with its games of chance and its creaking thrill rides. The best of the fifties blasted forth at maximum volume. Over the noise, Jenn shouted at Becca, &#x201c;Hey, you probably won&#x2019;t need that thing.&#x201d;</p><p><i>That thing </i>was a hearing device that looked like an iPod in possession of a single ear bud. It was called an AUD box and, despite what Jenn thought, Becca didn&#x2019;t use it to help with her hearing. At least not in the way Jenn thought she used it. Jenn and everyone else believed that the AUD box helped Becca understand what was being said to her by blocking out nearby noises that her brain wouldn&#x2019;t automatically block: like the noise from other tables that you might hear in a restaurant but normally be able to ignore when someone was talking to you. That was what Becca let people believe about the AUD box because it did, actually, block out <i>some</i> noise. Only, the noise it blocked was the noise inside the heads of the people who surrounded her. Without the AUD box she was bombarded by everyone&#x2019;s thoughts, and while hearing people&#x2019;s thoughts <i>could</i> have its benefits, most of the time Becca couldn&#x2019;t tell who was thinking what. So since childhood, the AUD box was what she wore to deal with her &#x201c;auditory processing problem,&#x201d; as her mom had taught her to call it. Thankfully, no one questioned why the AUD box&#x2019;s loud static helped her in understanding who was speaking. More important, no one knew that without it, she was one step away from reading their minds.</p><p>Becca said, &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ll turn it down,&#x201d; and she pretended to do so. Up on the stage, the Time Benders were rocking and rolling through &#x201c;Rock Around the Clock&#x201d; while on either side of the stage, some of the older audience members had begun to dance in keeping with the music&#x2019;s era.</p><p>That was when the first gust of smoke belched across the heads of the crowd. At first, it seemed logical that the smoke would be coming from the line of food booths, all doing brisk sales of everything from buffalo burgers to curly fries. Because of this, the Time Benders audience didn&#x2019;t take much note. But when there was a pause in the music and the Time Benders were getting ready for the sixties with a change of costumes and wigs, the sirens hooting from the road just beyond the fairgrounds&#x2019; perimeter indicated something serious was going on.</p><p>The smell of smoke got heavier. People started to move. A murmur became a cry and then a shout. Just at the moment that panic was about to set in, the regular MC for the show took the stage and announced that &#x201c;a small fire&#x201d; had broken out on the far side of the fairgrounds, but there was nothing to worry about as the fire department was there and &#x201c;as far as we know, all animals are safe.&#x201d;</p><p>The last part was a serious mistake. &#x201c;All animals&#x201d; meant everything from ducks to the 4-H steer lovingly brought up by hand and worth a significant amount of money to the child who would sell it at the end of the fair. In between ducks and steers were fancy chickens, fiber-producing alpacas, award-winning cats, sheep worth their weight in wool, and an entire stable filled with horses. Among the audience for the Time Benders were the owners of these animals, and they began pushing their way in the direction of the buildings in which all the animals were housed.</p><p>In short order, a melee ensued. Derric grabbed Becca and Becca grabbed Jenn, and they clung to each other as the crowd surged out of the midway and past the barn where the crafts were displayed. They burst out behind it into an open area that looked onto the show ring and to the buildings beyond.</p><p>At the far side of the show ring, the stables were safe. The fire, everyone saw at once, was opposite them on the side of the show ring that was nearer the road into town. But this was where the dogs, cats, chickens, ducks, and rabbits had been snoozing in three ramshackle sheds that flaked old white paint onto very dry hay. The farthest of these sheds was up in flames. Fire licked up the walls and engulfed the roof.</p><p>The fact that the fire department was directly across the street from the fairgrounds had the effect of getting manpower to the flames in fairly short order. But the building was old, the weather had been bone dry for nine weeks&#x2014;almost unheard of in the Pacific Northwest&#x2014;and there were hay bales along the north side of the structure. So the best efforts of the fire department were directed toward keeping the fire away from the <i>other</i> buildings while letting the one that was burning burn to the ground.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t a popular move. There were chickens and rabbits inside. There were dozens of 4-Hers who wanted to save those animals, and the news that someone had apparently released them at some time during the fire only made the onlookers crazed to get to them before they all got trampled. Soon enough there were too many fire chiefs and too few onlookers and enough chaos to make Derric, Jenn, and Becca head for the safety of the stables some distance away.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s going to get hurt,&#x201d; Becca said.</p><p>&#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t going to be one of us,&#x201d; Derric told her. &#x201c;Come on, over here.&#x201d; He took her hand and Jenn&#x2019;s, and together they made their way beyond the stables to where a woods grew up the side of a hill to a neighborhood tucked back into the trees. From this spot they could watch the action and listen to the chaos, and while they did this, Becca removed the ear bud from her ear and wiped her hot face.</p><p>As always, she heard the thoughts of her companions, Jenn&#x2019;s profane as usual, Derric&#x2019;s mild. But among Jenn&#x2019;s colorful cursing and Derric&#x2019;s wondering about the safety of the little kids whose parents were trying to keep them away from the fire, Becca heard quite clearly, <i>Come on, come on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. get it why don&#x2019;t you?</i> as if it was spoken right next to her.</p><p>She swung around, but it was dark on all sides, with the great fir trees looming above them and the cedars leaning heavy branches down toward the ground. At her movement, Derric looked at her and said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; and then shifted his gaze into the trees as well.</p><p>&#x201c;Is someone there?&#x201d; Jenn asked them both.</p><p>&#x201c;Becca?&#x201d; Derric said.</p><p><i>Out of here before those kids</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was enough to give Becca the answer to those questions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hayley Cartwright looked around for her sister Brooke, who&#x2019;d claimed that she was leaving the family&#x2019;s booth at Bayview Farmers&#x2019; Market just long enough to do her business in the rest room. Total lie. She&#x2019;d been gone thirty minutes, leaving Hayley and her mom to run the booth all by themselves when it was, minimally, a three-person job. Brooke did the bagging and the weighing of veggies, Hayley wrapped the flowers and boxed the jewelry, and their mom took the money and made change. But with Brooke gone, Hayley was left dancing from one side of the booth to the other and trying to keep her eye on everything but especially upon the jewelry, which was fashioned from sea glass, difficult to make, and her main source of personal income.</p><p>Not that people actually shoplifted from the Cartwrights, at least not people who knew them. Taking even a dime from the Cartwrights was close to the same as emptying the family&#x2019;s pitiful bank account, and everyone on the south end of Whidbey Island who knew the family also knew that. So most of the time people lined up patiently to pay for the flowers and veggies that the Cartwrights grew at Smugglers Cove Farm and Flowers. They chatted to each other in the warm early September sun, petted the myriad dogs who accompanied the market-goers among the colorful stalls, and listened to the music weekly supplied by one or another of the local marimba bands.</p><p>This day, though, a girl unknown to Hayley had been pawing through her necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and hair pieces for at least ten minutes. She&#x2019;d also been trying them on. She was very pretty, with a swimmer&#x2019;s broad shoulders and shapely arms and legs that were on full display beneath her tank top and shorts. She wore her hair in an odd Cleopatra style&#x2014;if Cleopatra had been extremely blonde&#x2014;and her bangs dipped almost into her eyes, which were so cornflower blue that only colored contact lenses could have achieved the hue.</p><p>She saw Hayley watching her as she was putting a third necklace around her ivory-skinned throat. She&#x2019;d already donned four of the bracelets, and she was reaching for one of the more complicated pairs of earrings quite as if there was nothing strange about decking herself out like a jewelry tree.</p><p>Seeing Hayley observing her, she said, &#x201c;I c&#x2019;n <i>never</i> decide a single thing when I&#x2019;m by myself. It&#x2019;s absolute murder if I&#x2019;m trying on clothes. My grandam is here somewhere&#x201d;&#x2014;here she looked around the crowded market distractedly&#x2014;&#x201c;and I guess I could ask her, but she&#x2019;s got the most <i>wretched</i> taste, which you&#x2019;d more or less have to expect from someone who carves up trees for a living. <i>Not</i> that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with carving up trees, mind you. I&#x2019;m Isis Martin, by the way. Egyptian. I mean the <i>name</i> is, not me. Isis was the goddess of something.

This rag-bag of exotic and mundane scraps (a metaphor that Kaye establishes in the foreword) spills forth palpable scenes of family and folklore, of friendships and of memorable events. Readers of Kaye's fiction or of the period will enjoy this title and look forward to the next installments.<br><i>- V. Louise Saylor, Eastern Washington Univ. Lib., Cheney</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.After 77 pages of family background--her mother was the daughter of a China-based missionary and her father was a British army officer--bestselling novelist Kaye ( The Far Pavilions ), at age 82, recalls her 10 years of idyllic childhood in India as a time in paradise, and her nine years of adolescence in England as a time in purgatory. Although written with gushing, romantic enthusiasm, her kaleidoscopic story of a long-lost innocence just before and after World War I helps to explain Kaye's idealization of the British Raj and her love for Kipling's verse. These loving memories of a beautiful land and its delightful people may surprise readers of Paul Scott's much better written Raj Quartet , but it is probably equally authentic. Photos not seen by PW.

In a vast marble Colosseum larger than Yankee Stadium, the people of Rome, patrician and commoner, flocked to see gladiators mangled beneath the hoofs and wheels of horses and chariots, slaughtered by half-starved wild beasts, and butchered by well-armed and armored professionals. With the Empire in decline, death and torture became the only spectacles that satisfied the decadent Romans' longing.

But is this life she lives the only path she&#x2019;s on? Taking inspiration from the myth of Emer and Cuchulain and featuring an all-star cast of mythical figures from all over the world, David Duchovny&#x2019;s darkly funny fantasy novel <i>Miss Subways</i> is one woman&#x2019;s trippy, mystical journey down parallel tracks of time and love. On the way, Emer will battle natural and supernatural forces to find her true voice, power, and destiny. A fairy tale of love lost and regained, <i>Miss Subways </i>is also a love letter to the city that enchants us all: New York.</p><p>"Fresh off a new season of the evergreen <i>X-Files</i> and a late-blooming music career, the multitalented Duchovny (<i>Bucky F*cking Dent</i>, 2016, etc.) offers a spooky domestic drama that is equal parts Nick Hornby and Neil Gaiman... An entertaining, postmodern fairy tale that tests the boundaries of love and fate." - Kirkus Reviews</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2018:</strong> In a poem by W.B. Yeats about Irish mythological figures, Emer and Cuchulain (coo-cullen), he calculates the cost of Cuchulain&#x2019;s wandering eye, describing how a dalliance with another woman meant Cuchulain &#x201c;lost the world and Emer for a kiss.&#x201d; In David Duchovny&#x2019;s <em>Miss Subways</em> another Emer faces a similar dilemma. Emer lives in New York City with her boyfriend Con, her writerly aspirations diverted into doing research for Con&#x2019;s opus on New World pre-Christian deities and folklore, her life devoted to Con&#x2019;s needs. Then Sid, a &#x201c;mini-me in a monkey suit&#x201d; with an Irish accent turns up on her door to tell her that Con has fallen for a fellow academic, Anansi, and that Emer must give him up to save his soul. When she protests, he asks &#x201c;Where are your lady balls? You need to remember why you fell in love in the first place.&#x201d; So begins a supernatural, darkly comic, downright weird quest, populated with a cast of mythical figures from every continent, for Emer to find her lady balls and take control of her destiny. Some mythical figures Emer must conquer on her way to finding her power; others appear in unexpected locales to do battle by her side. This inventive, philosophical, comic romp is a Valentine to the New York familiar to its residents (the subways, the cheap umbrellas, the doormen, the delivery guys). And although Emer may feel as though she&#x2019;s in a shaggy dog story for much of the book, the reader will recognize this as a fairy tale for grown-ups, one that restores the world, and Emer. <em>--Vannessa Cronin</em><b>David Duchovny</b> is a television, stage, and screen actor, as well as a screenwriter and director.

Rhoda Grauer, executive producer for the series, enlisted the assistance of many scholars, performers, advisers, and researchers, as well as the talents of Jonas, a veteran staff writer for The New Yorker , in this collaborative effort. The result combines history/criticism, traditionally applied to Western dance, with ethnology/anthropology, traditionally applied to non-Western dance, and draws cross-cultural comparisons based upon the way in which dance functions in societies (e.g., as an expression of religious worship, social order, or classical art). The examples span six continents and include Japanese kabuki and bugaku , Balinese wayang wong , Native American tribal dance, Indian bharata natyam , ballet, and modern dance . The expansive research is underscored by 275 illustrations, nearly half of which are in color. With innovative research and visuals to be savored, Dancing is highly recommended for both general and specific collections.<br><i>- Joan Stahl, National Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Powershift: Knowledge, Wealth, and Violence at the Edge of the 21st Century</h2><p>A study of power in the 1990s and beyond traces the shifting global power structures and describes how the very definition of power has changed in modern times</p><p><b>Alvin Toffler</b> (1928&#x2013;2016) was an American writer and futurist whose list of bestselling books includes <i>Future Shock</i>, <i>The Third Wave</i>, and<i> Powershift</i>. He was a cofounder of Toffler Associates, a consulting firm for companies and governments worldwide on advances in economics, technology, and social change. In France, where his work won the prestigious Prix du Meilleur Livre �tranger (Best Foreign Book Prize), Alvin was named an Officier de l&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.Following Future Shock ( LJ 7/70) and The Third Wave ( LJ 4/1/80), this final volume of Toffler's trilogy on revolutionary change argues that the control of knowledge has become the principal means to create wealth and power. Aided by the widespread use of computers and other communications technologies, this "powershift," Toffler predicts, will dramatically alter the world's political balance. The superpowers will no longer dominate, since massive military power and control of natural resources will diminish in importance. Access to the latest information will allow developing countries to skip stages of economic growth. On the business level, executives will use knowledge as an instrument to gain control of their companies. Unfortunately, Toffler's thesis suffers from an unclear concept of power, failing to distinguish clearly between influence and the use or threat of force, and some of his claims about the power of knowledge seem exaggerated. The book's best feature is the wide range of information it contains, presented in an easy-to-read style.

They halted at the edge of the trees, silently regarding summer fields thick with oats and the brooding castle beyond.<br>&#x201c;Castle Coorm,&#x201d; the leader, Fallion, whispered. &#x201c;As promised.&#x201d; The sight of it filled him with nostalgia and soothed his frayed nerves like mulled wine.<br>The pre-dawn sky still had one bright star in it, and the castle mostly lay in shadows, the limned walls looking soft blue instead of white. There were pinpricks of yellow in the tower windows, and watch-fires burned outside the city gates like blistering gems. The dancing fires, the smell of the smoke, beckoned him. But Fallion merely stood silently regarding the scene. The castle was falling into ruins, but was obviously still inhabited.<br>He had seen too much devastation, too many ruined cities since his return to Mystarria. The Courts of Tide had been laid waste. Its once-fair streets were now dark lanes, blockaded by gangs that fought like wild dogs to protect their few scraps of food and clothing. The women and children there had a haunted look. They had suffered too much rape, too much plunder.<br>The sight of it had left Fallion reeling. In a more perfect world, he told himself, the women would wear flowers in their hair, and children would not learn to fear strangers.<br>Upon the death of Fallion&#x2019;s father, Gaborn Val Orden, assassins from a dozen lands had descended upon Mystarria, hoping to strike down Fallion and his brother. These weren&#x2019;t ordinary assassins. These were powerful runelords that had taken brawn, stamina, speed, and grace from their subjects, making them warriors that no commoner could hope to withstand. And though Mystarria had been a wealthy country then, with many strong runelords of its own, it could not withstand the sustained onslaughts of such men.<br>Only by strengthening its forces could it hope to survive, but that required forcibles&#x2014;magical branding irons that could draw out an attribute from a vassal and then imbue it upon the lord.<br>But there was a dearth of forcibles. The rare blood metal from which they were made was running out. Rumors said that the lords of Kartish, far to the west, were hoarding what little they found, intent on protecting their own realms in the dark times to come.<br>Chancellor Westhaven, who had been left in charge of Mystarria, had even taken a journey to Kartish, hoping to sway those who had once been allies.<br>He had never returned. Some said that his mournful spirit could be seen at night in the towers at the Courts of Tide, wandering the hallways, rummaging through the empty lock-boxes in the treasure room.<br>And so Mystarria had been attacked on a dozen fronts, like a great bull taken down by jackals that ripped it apart and gorged themselves while leaving their prey still only half alive. Its treasuries had been looted, its towers knocked down, its farms and cities burned, its lands divided. The Warlords of Internook held the coast, while Beldinook took the east, and Crowthen to the north split the rest.<br>Frankly, after the rapes, the looting, and the murder, Fallion did not see that there was much of a country left worth fighting over.<br>He eyed the remains of Castle Coorm, dully surprised to see it still intact.<br>The towers of the castle stood, but dark stands of ivy grew up them, looking like rents in the darkness. The eastern-most walls were a decrepit gray, most of the lime having washed away after years of winter storms. A lone bullfrog bellowed amid the placid reeds of the moat.<br>Fallion held to the shadows. He wore a gray half-cape, fastened with a silver cape pin in the form of an owl, long black hair sweeping back over his shoulders, brown eyes so full of light that they seemed a perfect mirror for the distant fires. A naked blade gleamed silver in his hand.<br>He studied the fires, and for an instant an image came to mind of a vast rune made of flames, encircled by flames&#x2014;The Seal of the Inferno. It had been almost three years ago that he had first seen it in a dream while staring into the hearth after a midwinter&#x2019;s dinner. Since then he had begun practicing his skills as a flameweaver, listening to the many tongues of fire, seeking inspiration in sunlight. He knew which direction the seal lay, deep in the Underworld. The wheel of fire haunted him, came to mind a hundred times a day. He could not so much as glance at the sun or even a silver moon without seeing the afterimage of the rune imprinted on his retina.<br>He had crossed the oceans to find it. Just a couple hundred more miles now, and he would descend into the Mouth of the World, hoping to locate the Seal of the Inferno and repair the damage to it. By mending its defects and binding it to the Seal of Heaven and the Seal of Earth, he hoped to restore balance to the world, to remake it in the perfect image of the One True World of legend.<br>Behind him came Rhianna, following so close at Fallion&#x2019;s back that she touched him. Her fierce blue eyes looked troubled, and she clung to her quarterstaff as if she was lost at sea and it was the only thing that might save her from drowning.<br>&#x201c;I remember this place,&#x201d; she said, her voice shaky. &#x201c;I remember . . .&#x201d;<br>She placed a hand on Fallion&#x2019;s shoulder and just stood. Her flawless face was white with shock, a grimace of pain formed by the slash of her lips.<br>For nearly a decade, Rhianna had blocked out her memories of this place. But now, Fallion could see, they threatened to overwhelm her.<br>At her back stood Fallion&#x2019;s younger brother, Jaz, followed by their foster sister, Talon. Jaz carried a war bow carved from ruddy red reaver&#x2019;s horn. Talon bore a light saber that some dainty gentleman might have worn for a night on the town, but in her practiced hands, the blade would never be confused for a mere adornment.<br>&#x201c;What do you remember?&#x201d; Fallion asked Rhianna.<br>Rhianna&#x2019;s brows drew together in concentration; she recalled racing down a mountain on a force horse that had been richly endowed with runes of brawn and metabolism. Fallion sat in the saddle ahead of her, and she clung to him for dear life. Even then she realized that she was falling in love with him. She remembered thinking him strong and handsome, and she prayed that he would be able to save her. They must have been traveling at eighty miles per hour, for the pines at the margin of the road seemed to fly past. Her heart pounded as if trying to beat its way out of her chest, and in her young mind, she could not imagine that she would live until she reached the castle. Her stomach had ached, and she worried that something was eating her. A strengi-saat had placed its eggs in her womb to hatch, and the young were eating their way out. She remembered it all.<br>&#x201c;We were being chased by monsters,&#x201d; Rhianna said, suddenly planting her staff firmly in the ground. She had been a child back then, with a child&#x2019;s fears. But for years she had been practicing with weapons, and she was growing dangerous. The staff that she bore now was bejeweled and covered in runes. It had once belonged to the Earth King himself. She grimaced. &#x201c;Now we&#x2019;re back, and we&#x2019;re the monsters.&#x201d;<br>Jaz laughed. He always seemed to be light of heart lately. Rhianna had come on this journey because she loved Fallion, because she would throw herself in death&#x2019;s path to protect him. But Jaz had come because, as he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been following him around since I could crawl. I don&#x2019;t see why I should stop now.&#x201d;<br>Jaz said, &#x201c;I was sure we&#x2019;d blundered past this place ten leagues back. And look, there are people inside. You think if we beg nicely, they&#x2019;d part with a mug of ale?&#x201d;<br>Jaz sat down and tried pulling off a boot. It had mud inside and came free with a sucking sound.<br>&#x201c;People will do astonishing things for money,&#x201d; Fallion said, &#x201c;even part with perfectly good ale.&#x201d;<br>He turned back to the castle. The long war had taken its toll. A village had once thrived on the hill below, a place named Weeds. A few dozen cozy mud-and-wattle cottages had grown up here with roofs thatched from wheat straw. As a child, Fallion had imagined that they were living things, lounging among the herb and flower gardens, partitioned with rock walls. The homes had been shaded in the long summer by fruit trees.<br>He regarded the ruins of a cottage on a knoll, and suddenly had a memory from when he was a child of three. In it, his father had come home from his wanderings, and had taken him out into the village among the crowds. Fallion had ridden on his father&#x2019;s shoulder, until his father stopped beneath a cherry tree on the knoll. There, Fallion pulled the red cherries from the tree, and they were so ripe that they burst at his touch, and juice ran thick down his fingers. He licked it off and picked his fill, all the while begriming his father, he was sure now.<br>But his father had only laughed with delight.<br>Fallion remembered riding upon the shoulders of a king, being taller than everyone, looking down upon men that had dwarfed him, wishing that he could be that tall forever.<br>He smiled. It was a good memory, and one of only a handful that he recalled of his father. The journey across the ocean had been worth making just for that.<br>But no cottages graced the fields anymore. Nothing was left but burned-out remains: their rocky husks down in the distance looked like dead beetles.<br>The folk in the castle had probably burned the houses so that the monsters would not be able to hide in them. Strengi-saats, the enemy was called in the old tongue, the &#x201c;strong ones.&#x201d;<br>And it was rumored that worse things had begun to haunt the woods. It was rumored that one of them might even haunt Castle Coorm.<br>&#x201c;Castle Coorm has become an island, a refuge of stone besieged by a wilderness of trees,&#x201d; Fallion mused. &#x201c;Now there&#x2019;s not a hamlet within thirty leagues.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We should know,&#x201d; Talon groused. &#x201c;We just floundered through every bog between here and the Courts of Tide.&#x201d; She crouched, resting on her heels.<br>Fallion was more leg-sore and hungry than he had ever been. Worse, he had a bad cut on his calf. It wasn&#x2019;t much, but the smell of congealed blood drew strengi-saats.<br>He wasn&#x2019;t sure if he should try to rest here. He had heard a strange rumor of this place, the strangest that he&#x2019;d heard in his life. It was said that several years past, a woman of Coorm had given birth not to a child, but to a tree&#x2014;a short, stunted tree with a handful of roots and two gnarled limbs. The tree, it was said, had bark that was a ruddy gold. Fallion wondered at the tale. It was said that the woman&#x2019;s flesh was green, like one of the wizardborn filled with Earth Powers, and some speculated that her offspring was a &#x201c;World Tree,&#x201d; like the One True Oak of legend that had spread its branches wide, giving shelter to all of mankind at the beginning of creation.<br>Among the peasants, the idea of a woman giving birth to a World Tree somehow did not seem beyond the realm of possibility. After all, since the coming of the Earth King, Fallion&#x2019;s father, the world had changed. The children born after his coming were stronger than men in times past, wiser and more purposeful, even as the world around them grew stranger and more treacherous. Men were becoming more perfect.<br>So was evil.<br>The tree, so the tale went, had been planted in the castle green, where it could be protected and admired, but then a bandit came from the woods, Lord Hale, a man of great power.<br>It was said that he slaughtered the wizardess.<br>Many had fled from Coorm then, and for years now, there had been no news from the castle.<br>Suddenly, a woman screamed down below.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Jaz asked. He pulled on his boot, leapt up. It was not the drawn-out wail of someone grieving past loss. It was announced first by grunts and short yelps of pain, shrieks of terror.<br>&#x201c;Someone is fighting,&#x201d; Fallion said.<br>&#x201c;Someone is dying!&#x201d; Rhianna corrected.<br>From across the fields, at the eastern verge of the woods, a deep snarl erupted, like the sound of thunder on the horizon, followed by the strange bell-like cry of a strengi-saat.<br>In the woods just up the hill, a pair of crows suddenly cried out, &#x201c;Claw, claw, claw.&#x201d;<br>Fallion glanced up. The woods here and been burned back, blackening the great oaks, searing away the brush, leaving the strengi-saats fewer places to hide, Fallion speculated. Up in the nearby trees, he spotted the crows. The birds were half asleep, but they watched the castle as if it were the sprawling carcass of a dying giant.<br>The woman screamed again, her voice echoing from the castle walls. Fallion, willed his heart to slow, and listened.<br>The sounds of the scuffle at Coorm came to him with unnatural clarity, as often happened in the mountains on a clear morning.<br>He wished for more, half-wished that he had taken endowments of hearing or sight from others. Some had offered when he left&#x2014;the children that had served under him in the Gwardeen, there in the outposts at the Ends of the Earth. But he had declined. It was an evil thing to take an endowment from a man, for if a man gave you his strength, his heart might fail thereafter. Fallion could not bear the thought of using another person that way. Still, he had nearly three hundred forcibles in his pack as part of his inheritance, and if the need was great enough, he knew that someday he might yet have to take endowments.<br>There was a gruff cry, a man shouting, &#x201c;Damn the wench,&#x201d; followed by a smack, the sound of a fist pummeling a face. &#x201c;She bit me.&#x201d;<br>The woman&#x2019;s wail went silent, though she grunted and struggled still.<br>&#x201c;Open the gates!&#x201d; the attacker cried in his deep voice. &#x201c;Open the damned gates, will you?&#x201d;<br>In the hills, strengi-saats roared.<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to give a woman to the strengi-saats,&#x201d; Rhianna whispered.<br>The thought horrified her. She found her heart pounding so hard that she was afraid it would burst.<br>The strengi-saats wouldn&#x2019;t simply eat the woman. Though they were fierce carnivores, with claws like reaping hooks and teeth like scythes, they didn&#x2019;t simply rend one&#x2019;s flesh. No, one of the females would rape the woman, inserting a long ovipositor into the woman&#x2019;s womb so that it could incubate half a dozen leathery eggs.<br>Then the strengi-saat would drag the woman into the woods, hide her high among the limbs of a tree, and keep her, terrified but alive, until the eggs hatched, and the young ate their way from the woman&#x2019;s body.<br>&#x201c;Fools,&#x201d; Fallion growled. &#x201c;What are they thinking? In killing her this way, they only reinforce the numbers of their enemies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Something more heinous is going on here,&#x201d; Talon concluded. &#x201c;Perhaps that is what they want&#x2014;to increase the numbers of the strengi-saats.&#x201d;<br>The castle&#x2019;s gate began to creak open. Talon clutched her blade, which was as long as her arm and two fingers in width.<br>Fallion studied the sentries along the wall. He could see their shadowed forms, pacing. There were no more than half a dozen. Two were peering down inside the gates, watching whatever struggle was occurring, but the others showed better judgment, and kept their watch still.</p><h2>Idiot&#39;s Guides: Knitting Sweaters</h2><p><p>Stitching a sweater is a rite of passage for knitters.

THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY brings to life a long summer spent at Esterh�za, the summer palace of Prince Nicholas of Esterh�zy.<br><br>The blustering, bellowing prince entertained hundreds of guests at his rural retreat and demanded music for every occasion. As the months passed, Haydn was kept very busy writing and performing music for parties, balls, dinners, and even walks in the gardens. His orchestra members became homesick and missed their families. The anger, frustration, and longing of the musicians is expressed beautifully in the symphony born of the clever mind of Joseph Haydn who used it to convince Prince Nicholas that it was time to go home.<br><br>Wonderfully expressive illustrations by JoAnn E. Kitchel capture all the comedy and pathos of this unique symphony. Beautifully interpretive motifs and borders convey the setting and emotion of the story mirroring the structure of the symphony with the repetitive use of sets of four. Making classical music and history come alive with color and character, THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY ensures a place for the arts in the hearts and minds of children.</p><p>Anna Harwell Celenza is a musicologist and the author of several books for adults and children regarding music history and the history of art. Her children&#x2019;s books include THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY, PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION, GERSHWIN'S RHAPSODY IN BLUE, and VIVALDI'S FOUR SEASONS. Anna lives in Baltimore, Maryland.In this intriguing history lesson for music lovers, Prince Nicholas of Austria forbids his musicians from bringing their families to Estherh za, his summer palace in the Hungarian countryside. The court musicians under composer and royal music director Joseph Haydn's care grow increasingly homesick and restless, particularly when the prince extends his stay well into the autumn of 1772. "It will take a great deal of cleverness and tact to influence the prince," says Haydn. His solution: to compose a new symphony as a way of conveying the musicians' emotions to his employer. The real story behind Haydn's famous Symphony No. 45 (in F minor)Atracing the underlying moods that accompany each movement and ending with the musicians leaving the stage one by oneAwill likely make attentive listeners of its readers, as they gain a newfound appreciation for music's simultaneous subtlety and power (a CD recording is included). And if Celenza tweaks history by investing the characters with thoughts and emotions of her own devising (e.g., upon hearing the "explosive chords" and "surging melodies" of the "angry" first movement, the prince senses "the musicians' frustration over having to remain at Esterh za"), her interpretation of the events is plausible. Kitchel's (The Heart of a Friendship) brightly bordered watercolors verge on the simplistic, particularly the cartoonish features of the characters, but include plenty of historical detail. Ages 4-9.

While it&#x2019;s doubtful that anyone knows his actual name or anything at all about his true identity, or even if he&#x2019;s still alive, he&#x2019;s in his mid-thirties and lives completely off the grid, a criminal&#x2019;s criminal who does entirely as he pleases and is almost impossible to get in touch with. But within hours a private jet is flying this exceptionally experienced fixer and cleaner-upper from Seattle to New Jersey and right into a spectacular mess: one heister dead in the parking lot, another winged but on the run, the shooter a complete mystery, the $1.2 million in freshly printed bills god knows where and the FBI already waiting for Jack at the airport, to be joined shortly by other extremely interested and elusive parties. He has only forty-eight hours until the twice-stolen cash literally explodes, taking with it the wider, byzantine ambitions behind the theft. To contend with all this will require every gram of his skill, ingenuity and self-protective instincts, especially when offense and defense soon become meaningless terms.

I woke with a start and immediately put a hand on my gun. I took gasping breaths as my eyes adjusted to the light coming off my security screens. I looked over to the windowsill where I&#x2019;d set my watch. The sky was still as black as ink.<br><br>I took the gun out from under my pillow and put it on my nightstand. Breathe.<br><br>When I regained my composure I scanned the monitors. There was no one in the hallway or the elevator. Nobody in the stairs or the lobby. The only person awake was the night watchman, who looked too engrossed in a book to notice anything. My building was an old ten-�story, and I was on the eighth floor. It was a seasonal sort of place, so there were year-�round occupants in only about half the rooms and none of them ever got up early. Everyone was still asleep, or away for the summer.<br><br>My computer chirped again.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been an armed robber for close to twenty years. Paranoia comes with the territory, as well as the stack of fake passports and hundred-�dollar bills under the bottom drawer of my dresser. I started in this business in my teens. I did a few banks because I thought I&#x2019;d like the thrill of it. I wasn&#x2019;t the luckiest and I&#x2019;m probably not the smartest, but I&#x2019;ve never been caught, questioned or fingerprinted. I&#x2019;m very good at what I do. I&#x2019;ve survived because I&#x2019;m extremely careful. I live alone, I sleep alone, I eat alone. I trust no one.<br><br>There are maybe thirty people on earth who know I exist, and I am not sure if all of them believe I&#x2019;m still alive. I am a very private person out of necessity. I don&#x2019;t have a phone number and I don&#x2019;t get letters. I don&#x2019;t have a bank account and I don&#x2019;t have debts. I pay for everything in cash, if possible, and when I can&#x2019;t, I use a series of black Visa corporate credit cards, each attached to a different offshore corporation. Sending me an e-�mail is the only way to contact me, though it doesn&#x2019;t guarantee I&#x2019;ll respond. I change the address whenever I move to a different city. When I start getting messages from people I don&#x2019;t know, or if the messages stop bearing important information, I microwave the hard drive, pack my things into a duffel and start all over.<br><br>My computer chirped again.<br><br>I ran my fingers over my face and picked up the laptop from the desk next to my bed. There was one new message in my in-�box. All of my e-�mails get redirected through several anonymous forwarding services before they reach me. The data goes through servers in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Thailand before it gets chopped up and sent to accounts all over the world. Anybody tracing the IP wouldn&#x2019;t know which was the real one. This e-�mail had arrived at my first offshore address in Reykjavik some two minutes ago, where the server had encrypted it with my private-�key 128-�bit cipher. From there it had been forwarded to another address registered under a different name. Then another address, then another. Oslo, Stockholm, Bangkok, Caracas, S�o Paulo. It was daisy-�chained down the line ten times with a copy in each in-�box. Cape Town, London, New York, L.A., Tokyo. Now it was undetectable, untraceable, private and anonymous. The information had circled the world almost twice before it got to me. It was in all these in-�boxes, but my cipher key could unlock only one. I entered my pass code and waited for the message to decrypt. I could hear the hard drive doing a spin-�up and the CPU beginning to work. Five in the morning.<br><br>Outside the sky was empty, except for a few lights on in the skyscrapers, which looked like foggy constellations. I&#x2019;ve never liked July. Where I&#x2019;m from the whole summer is intolerably hot. The security monitors had browned out for a few seconds the night before, and I had to spend two hours checking them. I opened a window and put my fan next to it. I could smell the shipping yard outside&#x2014;�old cargo, garbage and salt water. Across the train tracks the bay stretched out like a giant oil slick. That early in the morning, only a half dozen or so headlights cut through the darkness. The fishing boats cast rigger beams over the nets, and the early ferries were setting off from the harbor. The fog rolled in from Bainbridge Island and through the city, where the rain stopped and the cargo express cast a shadow from the track going east. I took my watch off the windowsill and put it on. I wear a Patek Philippe. It doesn&#x2019;t look like much, but it will tell the correct time until long after everyone I&#x2019;ve ever known is dead and buried, the trains stop running and the bay erodes into the ocean.<br><br>My encryption program made a noise. Done.<br><br>I clicked on the message.<br><br>The sender&#x2019;s address had been obscured by all the redirects, but I knew instantly who it was from. Of the possibly thirty people who know how to contact me, only two knew the name in the subject line, and only one I knew for sure was alive.<br><br>Jack Delton.<br><br>My name isn&#x2019;t really Jack. My name isn&#x2019;t John, George, Robert, Michael or Steven, either. It isn&#x2019;t any of the names that appear on my driver&#x2019;s licenses, and it isn&#x2019;t on my passports or credit cards. My real name isn&#x2019;t anywhere, except maybe on a college diploma and a couple of school records in my safety-�deposit box. Jack Delton was just an alias, and it was long since retired. I&#x2019;d used it for a job five years ago and never again since. The words blinked on the screen with a little yellow tag next to them to show that the message was urgent.<br><br>I clicked it.<br><br>The e-�mail was short. It read: Please call immediately.<br><br>Then there was a phone number with a local area code.<br><br>I stared at it for a moment. Normally, when I got a message like this, I wouldn&#x2019;t even consider dialing the number. The area code was the same as mine. I thought about this for a second and came up with two conclusions. Either the sender had been extraordinarily lucky or he knew where I was. Considering the sender, it was probably the latter. There were a few ways he could&#x2019;ve done it, sure, but none of them would&#x2019;ve been easy or cheap. Just the possibility that I&#x2019;d been found should have been enough to send me running. I have a policy never to call numbers I don&#x2019;t know. Phones are dangerous. It is hard to track an encrypted e-�mail through a series of anonymous servers. Tracking someone by their cell phone is easy, however. Even regular police can trace a phone, and regular police don&#x2019;t deal with guys like me. Guys like me get the full treatment. FBI, Interpol, Secret Service. They have rooms full of officers for that sort of thing.<br><br>I looked at the blinking name long and hard. Jack.<br><br>If the e-�mail were from anyone else, I would&#x2019;ve deleted it by now. If the e-�mail were from anyone else, I&#x2019;d be closing the account and deleting all my messages. If the e-�mail were from anyone else, I&#x2019;d be frying the computers, packing my duffel and buying a ticket for the next flight to Russia. I&#x2019;d be gone in twenty minutes.<br><br>But it wasn&#x2019;t from anyone else.<br><br>Only two people in the world knew that name.<br><br>I stood up and went to the dresser by my window. I pushed aside a pile of money and a yellow legal pad full of notes. When I&#x2019;m not on a job, I translate the classics. I pulled a white shirt out of the drawer, a gray two-�piece suit from the closet and a leather shoulder holster from my dresser. I fished a little chrome revolver from the box on top: a Detective Special with the trigger guard and hammer spur filed off. I filled it with a handful of .38 hollow points. When I was dressed and ready, I took out an old prepaid international phone, powered it up and punched in the numbers.<br><br>The phone didn&#x2019;t even ring. It just went right to connection.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a hard man to find, Jack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want you to come to my clubhouse,&#x201d; Marcus said. &#x201c;Before you ask, you still owe me.&#x201d;</p><h2>Dorothea Lange (Aperture Masters of Photography Number Five)</h2><p>Collects examples of Dorothea Lange&#39;s photographs of conditions during the Depression, farmers, and rural communities</p><p>Mark Durden is an artist and writer.

A fast-paced page-turner, it has everything: sex, wit, humor, and adventures. But it is an impressively researched and important story.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Fromkin, author of <i>Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer</i><br><i>Vienna, 1814</i> is an evocative and brilliantly researched account of the most audacious and extravagant peace conference in modern European history. With the feared Napoleon Bonaparte presumably defeated and exiled to the small island of Elba, heads of some 216 states gathered in Vienna to begin piecing together the ruins of his toppled empire. Major questions loomed: What would be done with France? How were the newly liberated territories to be divided? What type of restitution would be offered to families of the deceased? But this unprecedented gathering of kings, dignitaries, and diplomatic leaders unfurled a seemingly endless stream of personal vendettas, long-simmering feuds, and romantic entanglements that threatened to undermine the crucial work at hand, even as their hard-fought policy decisions shaped the destiny of Europe and led to the longest sustained peace the continent would ever see.<br><br>Beyond the diplomatic wrangling, however, the Congress of Vienna served as a backdrop for the most spectacular Vanity Fair of its time. Highlighted by such celebrated figures as the elegant but incredibly vain Prince Metternich of Austria, the unflappable and devious Prince Talleyrand of France, and the volatile Tsar Alexander of Russia, as well as appearances by Ludwig van Beethoven and Emilia Bigottini, the sheer star power of the Vienna congress outshone nearly everything else in the public eye.<br><br>An early incarnation of the cult of celebrity, the congress devolved into a series of debauched parties that continually delayed the progress of peace, until word arrived that Napoleon had escaped, abruptly halting the revelry and shrouding the continent in panic once again.<br><br><i>Vienna, 1814</i> beautifully illuminates the intricate social and political intrigue of this history-defining congress&#x2013;a glorified party that seemingly valued frivolity over substance but nonetheless managed to drastically reconfigure Europe&#x2019;s balance of power and usher in the modern age.</p><p>A Fulbright scholar with a master&#x2019;s degree from Cambridge University, DAVID KING is the author of the acclaimed Finding Atlantis.

Dangers lurked everywhere on the poor, unlit roadways. Cutthroat highwaymen preyed on isolated travelers, and inns were hardly safe havens, either, often little better than "murderer's dens." Venturing out into the bleak postwar world was for "the fearless, the foolish, or the suicidal." During the autumn of 1814, it was also for the idealistic and the idle. Hordes of pleasure-seekers would flock to Vienna for an unprecedented pageant.<br><br>The occasion was the Congress of Vienna, the long-awaited peace conference to decide the future of Europe. Kings, queens, princes, princesses, dukes, duchesses, diplomats, and about a hundred thousand other visitors would make their way to the central European city, swelling the population by as much as a third. No one, though, it must be said, really had an idea of what to expect. The invitation for the congress had been sent by way of an announcement in the newspaper.<br><br>The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars had ripped Europe apart. For the first time in history, enormous armies based on universal conscription had marched across the continent to wage a "total war." France had set the standard for this comprehensive mobilization of the people with the famous decree of August 1793:<br><br>The young shall fight; married men shall forge weapons and transport supplies; the women will make tents and clothes and will serve in the hospitals; the children will make old linen into lint; the old men will have themselves carried into the public squares to rouse the courage of fighting men.<br><br>By the end of the war in the spring of 1814, the suffering had been immense--a terrible ordeal that ruined states, wrecked economies, and ravaged families. As many as 5 million people were dead, and many more had been permanently or seriously disabled. Entire villages had been wiped off the map. Lands had been devastated, laws trammeled, and atrocities committed on a horrific scale.<br><br>The many issues arising out of this wreckage were, to be sure, tangled, thorny, and controversial. During the war, the Allied powers had understandably hoped to postpone the many difficult decisions until after victory. Now that Napoleon had been defeated, the only matter that had been officially decided was the question of France, which had been settled back in May 1814, after two months of wrangling following the capture of the capital.<br><br>According to the terms of the Treaty of Paris, France's frontiers were redrawn as they had been on the first of January 1792. This meant that France would have to surrender the vast majority of its conquests, but not, in fact, all of them. Any territory that France had seized by that date twenty-two years before would be retained, including communities in the northeast, Chambery in Savoy, the former papal enclave of Avignon, and even some colonies in the new world. Thanks to the treaty, France would actually possess more territory and a greater population than it had under Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI.<br><br>The Allies had hoped that such generous terms would help the new king, Louis XVIII, establish himself on the throne, and at the same time, reintegrate his country peacefully into the international community. That's also why the victors spared France many of the usual penalties inflicted on a defeated power. There was no indemnity to pay, no foreign occupation army to endure, and no limitation, in any way, on the size of the army. This was, in many ways, a remarkably lenient agreement.<br><br>Everything else, however, remained unresolved. The Vienna Congress would have to make some hard decisions about the former empire and its many satellite kingdoms. At stake was virtually all of western Europe, vast realms east of the Rhine, and some highly coveted islands from the Caribbean to the East Indies.<br><br>The most difficult of these questions, at least at the beginning, was the fate of Poland. Napoleon had called this country the "key to the vault," and the so-called enlightened despots of the eighteenth century had tried to seize as much of its strategic territory as possible, carving it up no fewer than three times. By 1795, Poland had completely disappeared from the map, devoured, as Frederick the Great had said, "like an artichoke, leaf by leaf."<br><br>Russia had ended up with the lion's share of Polish territory, including Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, and eastern Poland. Austria had taken the ancient capital of Krakow, along with the rich agricultural region of eastern Galicia and the salt mines of Tarnopol. Prussia had seized Warsaw, Gdansk, and the strip of territory running north to the sea later known as the "Polish Corridor." For many, such a cynical and ruthless display of power politics was simply indefensible.<br><br>During the war, Napoleon had played on these sentiments, blasting the Polish partitions as "unforgivable, immoral, and impolitic." He promised the Poles that if they could prove to him that they were "worthy of being a nation," he would restore their country. But despite the many Polish sacrifices, Napoleon never did more than create the tiny Duchy of Warsaw, and exploit it ruthlessly. The Vienna Congress seemed an excellent opportunity finally to restore Poland, though finding a solution was not going to be easy.<br><br>Napoleon, moreover, had been a fertile kingmaker, placing family and friends on thrones all over the continent, from Italy to Holland to Spain. Napoleon had also created brand-new kingdoms in Germany, such as the Kingdom of Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Saxony. What were the victors going to do with all the newly minted monarchs desperately clutching their crowns? What, for that matter, was going to happen to the older ruling families who had been ousted in the Napoleonic whirlwind and were now lobbying for a return to their kingdoms? The Vienna Congress was gearing up for an unusual battle royal for the thrones of Europe.<br><br>In addition, there was also a controversy brewing about the works of art that had been stolen. In only a few years, Napoleon and his Grande Armee had earned a reputation as history's most audacious thieves. Countless masterpieces from Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and Rembrandt were carted up and carried off by Napoleon's henchmen. The emperor's goal was simple: to make the city of Paris, as he put it, "the most beautiful that could ever exist." The Frenchman in charge of the art confiscations, Dominique-Vivant Denon, acted with a merciless efficiency, and transformed his museum, the Louvre, into an artistic "wonder of the world."<br><br>Now all these sculptures, paintings, jewels, tapestries, and other stolen treasures were once again up for grabs. The French, of course, insisted on retaining their war trophies, and the Allied powers had tentatively agreed, adding a clause to the Treaty of Paris allowing France to keep their loot. But in the autumn of 1814 there was a new call to return the art to its previous owners, and this motion was particularly popular among the heavily despoiled lands such as Italy and the Netherlands.<br><br>Indeed along with the official delegations, there were many informal and unofficial representatives, often self-appointed, that came to press their own hopes and projects. As the form of the congress had been vague, many believed that they had a right to participate in the decision making and arrived fully expecting to do so. These private delegations would be selling everything from constitutions to songs. One American entrepreneur, Dr. Justus Bollmann, arrived with a whole portfolio of projects, including a plan to create the first steamship company on the Danube.<br><br>There were delegations coming from Frankfurt, Lubeck, and Prague to protect the rights of Jewish minorities, so recently granted under Napoleon and now at risk of being repealed. One group wanted the congress to launch a crusade against piracy around the world, from the corsairs infesting the Mediterranean to the buccaneers raiding the Caribbean. Representatives of publishing firms came to Vienna to address another kind of piracy, "the gang of robbers known as literary pirates" who unscrupulously preyed "with impunity against authors and publishers." The hope was to create an international copyright to protect intellectual property.<br><br>Everyone, it seemed, had a vision of how the postwar world should best be reconstructed. The problem, however, was that the peacemakers were far more divided than it was imagined. And all the underlying differences, which had been so successfully suppressed in the life-and-death struggle against Napoleon, would now reemerge in Vienna with a vengeance.<br><br>The Habsburg capital was a good choice for the world meeting. Geographically and culturally, Vienna was the heart of Europe. Until as late as August 1806, Vienna had been the center of the Holy Roman Empire, the gigantic, ramshackle realm that had been dismantled by Napoleon. After nearly a thousand-year run, looming over central Europe at times with a menacing and other times tottering presence, the Holy Roman Empire was no more. Imperial majesty and grandeur, however, had far from faded.<br><br>"The city proper," one traveler noted on entering Vienna's gates, "seems like a royal palace." Grand baroque mansions lined the narrow, twisting lanes that snaked their way through the old medieval center. Spires, domes, towers, and neoclassical columns carved in bright white stone, each roof and facade looked more sumptuous and elaborately adorned than the next. Rows of large bay windows predominated, overlooking one of the greenest capitals in Europe, a fact that was due at least partly to the foresight of the eighteenth-century empe...</p><h2>Mental Math in the Primary Grades</h2><p>Builds mental math skills by promoting understanding of the base ten system through patterns.

Death was present in the street, but there was nothing dramatic or sinister about my appearance. That night, I was neatly dressed in gray slacks and a V-neck sweater. In the outside pocket of my black raincoat, I carried a Brazilian-made semiautomatic pistol with skateboard tape attached to the grip. My Freedom ID card was concealed within a specially designed sleeve that made it impossible for the EYE system to detect my location.<br><br>A delivery van passed through the intersection, its tires hissing on the wet asphalt. I slipped on a phone headset and Laura whispered into my ear.<br><br>Ten-Thirty-Three on Flatbush Avenue and Farragut Road. One unit responding.<br><br>Any police activity in Bensonhurst?<br><br>Checking... It felt as if Laura was a real woman looking up a message board or gazing out a window, but she was only a Shadow. Somewhere in the Internet, one computer was talking to another, checking the data on a Web site that provided live-time reports of New York City police and fire department activity.<br><br>Nothing, Mr. Underwood.<br><br>My target had rented a two-bedroom house that reminded me of something a child would build with plastic blocks. It had a low brick wall in front that guarded a patch of concrete, painted grass green. There were red aluminum awnings over the two front windows and the front door.<br><br>Since my Transformation, I am capable of a limited range of emotional responses: curiosity, boredom, and disgust. I had been curious if Stetsko could squeeze his Mercedes-Benz between a blue delivery van and a mud-splattered Toyota. Now I was bored with his cautious maneuvering and ready to complete my assignment.<br><br>A young woman wearing a sequined green nightclub dress was sitting in the passenger seat of the Mercedes. Because she was a witness, she would also have to be neutralized. I would start with a head shot for Stetsko through the side window, circle the car and deal with this secondary target, then circle the car again for confirmation shots. The sequence wasnt difficult, but it would make more noise.<br><br>Any police activity, Laura?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>A minute passed.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>When Stetsko pulled out again for another try, the woman got out of the car. Like a photon of light, her green dress shimmered down the sidewalk, passed through the squeaky gate, and disappeared into the house. At that moment, my job became simple, direct, and clear.<br><br>The Mercedes moved six inches back toward the curb and then stopped. Stetskos head swung back and forth like a man watching a tennis match. He pulled the steering wheel hard to the right and the car made a squeaking noise.<br><br>Sixty-Second Street was dark and no one was on the sidewalk, but that didnt make me feel lonely or frightened. The rotting smell from a Dumpster appeared as a brownish-green color in my mind, but it didnt generate an emotional reaction. X = X. The world has no meaning aside from what is.<br><br>Across the street, Stetsko finally finished parking the car. He smiled, switched off the engine, and patted the steering wheel as if the Mercedes were a racehorse that had just survived a dangerous steeplechase.<br><br>Show scanned photograph, I told Laura and my targets face appeared on the smartphone screen.<br><br>Look right. Look left. No one was in the street. I walked over to the car, held up the phone, and compared Stetskos photograph to the reality in front of me. Then I raised my weapon and shot reality in the head.<br><br>2<br><br>I turned away from my target, walked five blocks east to Gravesend Park, and tossed the gun into a storm drain. Perhaps one day a city sewer worker might find this artifactrusty and covered with mudbut it would have no connection with my identity.<br><br>A few blocks from the park I waved down an unregistered cab and paid the driver cash to take me back to Manhattan. For the last two years, Ive lived in the top loft of an industrial building in New Yorks Chinatown. My landlord, an older woman named Margaret Chen, likes the fact that I always pay in cash and never ask for a receipt. There were only three rules for the tenants in her building: no checks, no fireworks, and no slaughtering chickens.<br><br>Before my Transformation, I lived like an ordinary Human Unit in an Upper East Side apartment with cooking pots and self-assembled teak-veneer furniture. Nowadays I try to own only one object in each category: a chair and a table, a bed and a blanket, a cup and a spoon. The loft has been used as a factory space by different businesses, and some of them left obsolete equipment bolted to the floor or shoved against the wall. Theres an industrial sewing machine with a black rubber drive belt, a drill press, and a piano-sized machine that used to stamp advertising slogans on pencils.<br><br>My living space is quiet and clean and unencumbered. None of the objects I possess trigger memories that are separate from their function. I own a cup that is only a cup, not something that reminds me of a trip to Italy.<br><br>After locking the entrance door, I removed all my clothes and placed them in nylon bags. Everything worn that evening would be washed or dry-cleaned at a laundry on Mott Street. Within twenty-four hours, all the invisible burned and unburned particles from the fired bullets would disappear.<br><br>I took a shower, pulled on a sweatshirt and warm-up pants, and returned to the main room. Rule #4 states that I must supply my Shell with a minimum of two thousand calories a day, so I opened a bottle of a nutritional drink developed for the elderly called ComPlete, poured it in the cup, and mixed in a tablespoon of a coarse fiber supplement.<br><br>I have a good memory, but dont like to re-experience the past. If thoughts are not controlled, then each remembered experience becomes an alternative reality. When I thought about shooting Peter Stetsko, my mind brought up different detailsthe sound of my shoes walking across the street and the vision of the first bullet shattering the side window. But these memories didnt generate feelings of regret or happiness. I have a Spark that creates my thoughts.<br><br>The Spark is bright and pure and transcendent, but its held captive within a Shell of flesh and bone.<br><br>The woman in the green shimmery dress and all the other Human Units walking around New York City feel emotions because their Spark is attached to their Shell.<br><br>But all my attachments have melted away. Yes, I can breathe and swallow and fire a handgun. In many ways, I resemble a human being. But there is nothing inside me. Im filled with darkness.<br><br>I opened up a second bottle of ComPlete, then turned on my computer and spoke to Edward. Like Laura, Edward is a Shadowa speech-recognition program connected to a computer with reactive intelligence. After you purchase and download a Shadow, you can pick their sex, age, language, and general personality. There are Shadows that can tell jokes, help you stop smoking, or say that they love you. You can spend the day chatting with a Shadow programmed to be a cute teenage girl or a Shadow who soundsand actslike your mother.<br><br>Hello, Edward.<br><br>Good evening, Mr. Underwood. Edward had a British accent and was programmed to be polite and formal. How may I help you?<br><br>Please show A Boy for Baxter.<br><br>From the beginning, sir?<br><br>Yes. Thank you.<br><br>A Boy for Baxter is a documentary film about a boy named Gordon who is given a specially trained service dog named Baxter. Gordon is a Native American child whose brain was damaged in utero when his birth mother drank alcohol and sniffed gasoline. He was adopted as a baby by Don and Pat Miller, a Quaker couple, with two other children. The movie begins when Gordon is eight years old. He throws toys at his sisters, tries to jump out of a car window, and pulls all the paint cans off a shelf at a hardware store. But Gordons tantrums are the most spectacular part of the film. He lies on the floor, screaming and pounding his fists. When Pat tries to help him, the boy picks up a lamp and smashes it against the wall.<br><br>After several boring scenes where Gordons parents talk to psychologists and cry, a service-dog agency agrees to see if the boy can live with a pet. This is when Gordon meets Baxter, a German shepherd, at a dog-training school in Oregon. During the weeks after I left the Ettinger Clinic, I watched one particular scene hundreds of times. Gordon is at the training school with his parents and two sisters, but somehow Baxter knows that hes supposed to be attached to this Human Unit. The dogs head tilts to the left, then tilts to the right, and then he jumps up onto a sofa next to the boy.<br><br>The rest of the film shows Baxter and Gordon together. When Gordon is worried or distressed the dog pushes him down, gets on top of him, and licks his face. If the boy lies on the floor screaming and curled up in a ball, the dog pushes his muzzle through the locked arms as if he is forcing open a puzzle.<br><br>I would like to own a service dog that would be trained to perceive the different emotions displayed by Human Units. The dog would bark or wag its tail or lick my hand to tell me what someone else was feeling. Together, we would be almost a person.<br>The following morning I took another shower, drank a bottle of ComPlete, and wrote a message in soft language to Miss Holquist, the woman in charge of the Special Services Section. Miss Holquist is my supervisor. She picks my targets and pays me when Ive completed an assignment.<br><br>// Made a successful presentation to the customer. No further meeting is necessary.<br><br>Later that day, my payment would be transferred to an account with a British-owned bank on the island of Malta. For my day-to-day expenses, I keep a few thousand dollars with an American bank that has ATM machines all over the city. Both banks require that you use an optical fingerprint sensor when you access your account. My real fingerprints would have been tracked back to my previous identity, but Miss Holquist solved that problem. When I changed my name, she gave me three gummy fingers made out of soft plastic. Each finger had the loops and whirls of an unregistered print that was probably taken from someone who lived in a jungle. If I pressed one of these plastic fingers against a sensor pad, my bank account appeared on a display screen.<br><br>Peter Stetskos death was mentioned two days later in a brief article in the New York Post. According to the police, Stetsko was an investment consultant to the Russian community in Brighton Beach. He had no criminal record, but had once been questioned at Kennedy Airport about the large amount of currency in his carry-on bag.<br><br>Now that my job was completed, I resumed my usual activities. I dropped off my laundry, bought a case of ComPlete, and dust-mopped the floor. I like watching sports on my computeranything with continual activity that makes my eyes follow a ball. That night I spent three hours watching a Gaelic football match even though I didnt understand the rules.<br><br>The next morning, I woke up at 6 a.m. An orange light glowed behind a line of buildings, and then the sun floated upward past rooftop water tanks. At 8 a.m., my computer beeped and Edward spoke softly into my earphone.<br><br>Good morning, sir.<br><br>Morning, Edward.<br><br>I hope youre feeling well, sir.<br><br>Im functional.<br><br>Theres some new e-mail in your message box.<br><br>Usually, Miss Holquist sends me e-mails with soft language through the public Internet, but this was coded information sent through the Darknet. I accessed the decoding software on my computer, typed in the activation key, and read:<br><br>// I realize that youve just finished a job, but weve received an emergency request to deal with a problem in Great Britain. Please let me know in the next 24 hours if you wish to accept or reject the assignment. HOLQUIST.<br><br>As usual, the message included the name and photograph of the target, his last known address, and the fee I would receive for the job.<br><br>I went online and did some quick research. The target was an Englishman named Victor Mallory who was the former CEO of a private equity fund called Endeavor Investments. Endeavor had gone bankrupt a year ago and now Mallory was being sued in several countries. I assumed that I had been hired by an investor who wanted a more direct means of expressing his annoyance.<br><br>Normally, I would be given a few weeks of free time before my next assignment. Miss Holquists unexpected request made my Spark bounce around inside my Shell, so I decided to calm my agitation by visiting the pedestrian walkway that runs across the Brooklyn Bridge. Two granite and limestone towers hold a pair of massive cables that display catenary curvesa three-dimensional display of a hyperbolic cosine function. Attached to the curves is a web of diagonal and vertical cables that hold up the bridge platforms. When I stand at the center point and look outward, it appears as if the sky is divided into clearly marked sections. Randomness disappears, and Im able to sort through my wayward thoughts and place them in different boxes.</p><h2>James Madison and the Making of America</h2><p>In James Madison and the Making of America, historian Kevin Gutzman looks beyond the way James Madison is traditionally seen -- as &#34;The Father of the Constitution; -- to find a more complex and sometimes contradictory portrait of this influential Founding Father and the ways in which he influenced the spirit of today&#39;s United States. Goodreads</p><p><p>Kevin R. C. Gutzman is the author of the New York Times bestseller <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution, of Virginia's American Revolution</i>, and (with Thomas E.

His lands were extensive, his slaveholdings were notable, and his family connections were impressive. In a society that privileged the wealthy to a notable degree, James Jr.&#x2019;s world was his oyster.<br>Piedmont Virginia lay west of the Tidewater region that had been dominated by Virginia planters for well over a century. Life was cruder there, and tradition less powerful. Social status figured very strongly in a young man&#x2019;s life, but not to the degree that it did in the coastal counties. If ever a common Virginian doffed his hat as young Madison passed, Madison was not quite so snobbish as a Byrd, Carter, or Harrison. Still, like them, Madison knew his place.<br>As the scion of a prominent planter family, Madison&#x2014;unlike most Virginia boys&#x2014;received an enviable education. First, he attended a small school for sons of the elite in King and Queen County run by Donald Robertson. Next, from 1767 to 1769, his father hired an Episcopal priest tutor to live at Montpelier as Madison&#x2019;s, and possibly his siblings&#x2019;, teacher.2 Finally, at age eighteen, Madison went on to the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Along the way, Madison read widely in Greek and Latin. He imbibed strong republican sentiments as well as a skeptical attitude toward officeholders.<br>Opting for Princeton was uncommon among Virginia bluebloods. Madison went there to avoid reputedly unhealthy Williamsburg.3 More commonly, boys of his class went to England&#x2019;s Inns of Court or Scotland&#x2019;s University of Edinborough for advanced professional training in law or medicine, or, like Thomas Jefferson, they spent a few years at the colonial college, William and Mary. At William and Mary, nominally Episcopalian, the students were not notably studious and the curriculum was far from rigorous.<br>Princeton, on the other hand, had a president unlike any in Virginia. The Reverend John Witherspoon was a Presbyterian, a recent immigrant from Scotland.4 As a matter of course, his attitudes about the relationship between church and state, government and religion, the conscience and society were different from those to which Madison would have been exposed at William and Mary. Witherspoon contributed substantially to the course of American philosophy through his devotion to the Scottish Enlightenment, then in full flower, and transmission of Scottish commonsense philosophy to America.<br>Witherspoon joined leading figures in Scotland&#x2019;s philosophical establishment in promoting this philosophy. It downplayed the utility of &#x201c;metaphysical&#x201d; thought, preferring hardheaded realism, and held that everyone carried the ability to achieve insight into the true and the good by applying his mental faculties to the world around him. Not books, but experience was the best guide.5 In other words, Witherspoon was Aristotelian, not Platonic&#x2014;with a vengeance, and he believed that the common man could participate in government along with the aristocrat.<br>Witherspoon taught, as a Presbyterian minister could be expected to do, that man was self-centered and not to be trusted. Among other sources for this teaching was the Scottish philosopher David Hume, with whom Witherspoon was not uniformly in tune. Famously, Madison would turn Hume&#x2019;s teaching to good account in Federalist No. 10&#x2014;and, indeed, throughout his career. We can find many points of similarity between Witherspoon&#x2019;s beliefs and Madison&#x2019;s, but Madison clearly was not an undiscriminating student. For example, Witherspoon held state support of Christianity to be essential to the health of society and of Christianity, while Madison ultimately rejected that idea, with world-historic significance, as we shall see.6<br>Although he would later win acclaim for his learnedness, Madison was never a cold, calculating scholar. Rather, he always demonstrated an active sense of humor. Proof of this from his college days is provided by some poetry Madison contributed to an intramural dispute.<br>Princeton students, it seems, had organized competing literary social clubs, the Whigs and the Cliosophians. Madison took the lead among Whigs in a doggerel war in 1771&#x2013;1772, contributing several poems to the ongoing conflict.7 The editors of Madison&#x2019;s papers infer that the Whigs were the socially elite group, while their rivals&#x2019; backgrounds often formed the grist for Whig mockery.8 Among the choicest bits was this:<br><i>Keep up you[r] minds to humourous themes</i><br><i>And verdant meads &amp; flowing streams</i><br><i>Untill this tribe of dunces find</i><br><i>The baseness of their grovelling mind</i><br><i>And skulk within their dens together</i><br><i>Where each ones stench will kill his brother.</i><br>In light of which, you can only imagine how Homeric the quality of the rest must have been. But I will spare you.<br>While at Princeton, Madison decided to study law on the side. He bought the books he thought he needed for that purpose and, in the fashion of those days, began to read them.9 Very few American legal scholars took classes in law at the time. Instead, they commonly read leading texts and apprenticed to individual members of the bar. Madison&#x2019;s course, then, was nothing unusual. Nor, I wager, was his experience. Madison&#x2019;s first flush of tepid enthusiasm (in December 1773) soon gave way before the reality of legal study, which he described (in January 1774) as &#x201c;coarse and dry.&#x201d; Fortunately for him and for us, Madison seems to have abandoned his hobby almost instantly.<br>In 1772, Madison entered upon a very interesting correspondence with one of his Princeton classmates, Philadelphia&#x2019;s William Bradford. Bradford, who one day would serve briefly as George Washington&#x2019;s attorney general, broached subjects philosophical and religious with Madison, and the Virginian responded in kind.10<br>At this point, Madison was still prone, in the fashion of his Princeton instructors, to religious speculations and philosophical diversions. For example, Madison wrote Bradford at one point that, although of course young men would be ambitious, &#x201c;Nevertheless a watchful eye must be kept on ourselves lest while we are building ideal monuments of Renown and Bliss here we neglect to have our names enrolled in the Annals of Heaven.&#x201d;11 Warming to the subject, Madison went on to say that, &#x201c;As to myself I am too dull and infirm now to look out for any extraordinary things in this world for I think my sensations for many months past have intimated to me not to expect a long or healthy life, yet it may be better with me after some time tho I hardly dare expect it and therefore have little spirit and alacrity to set about any thing that is difficult in acquiring and useless in possessing after one has exchanged Time for Eternity.&#x201d; Madison, aged twenty-one, went on to advise his pal not to be swayed by the allure of &#x201c;those impertinent fops that abound in every City to divert you,&#x201d; but to stick to his resolution to study &#x201c;History and the Science of Morals.&#x201d; Fortunately, Madison said, his secluded perch in ultrarural Orange County insulated him from such temptations, which &#x201c;breed in Towns and populous places, as naturally as flies do in the Shambles.&#x201d;<br>Bradford replied with an expression of concern for Madison&#x2019;s health.12 Little could he know that Madison would be fatigued and often on the verge of death for another sixty-four years. In their exchanges, Madison made clear that he respected the ministry and wished his friend would enter upon that profession; the editors of his papers infer that perhaps he would have liked to become a minister, if it were not for his health.13 The twenty-two-year-old Madison also noted that, &#x201c;I do not meddle with Politicks.&#x201d; Events would soon bring a change in that sentiment.<br>In his letter of December 1, 1773, Madison struck out on a new path.14 Since Bradford&#x2019;s Pennsylvania was, along with New Jersey and Rhode Island, one of three colonies without established churches, Madison asked him to describe the Pennsylvania &#x201c;fundamental principles of legislation&#x201d; and &#x201c;particularly the extent of your religious Toleration.&#x201d; Bradford had finally decided to become an attorney, and Madison did not want to rush him. Rather, he asked him please to provide this information once he had &#x201c;obtained sufficient insight.&#x201d;<br>Displaying a systematic approach to political and philosophical topics that would soon be commented upon by his colleagues as characteristic of his statesmanship, Madison gave Bradford two specific questions to answer for him: (1) &#x201c;Is an Ecclesiastical Establishment absolutely necessary to support civil society in a supream Government?&#x201d; and (2) &#x201c;How far is it hurtful to a dependant State?&#x201d; Presumptuously, Madison suggested Bradford might attend to these issues &#x201c;in the course of your reading and consulting experienced Lawyers &amp; Politicians upon.&#x201d; He awaited a report on &#x201c;the Result of your reserches.&#x201d;<br>Bradford&#x2019;s next missive included an enclosure describing the Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773.15 Madison responded by saying that, &#x201c;I verily believe the frequent Assaults that have been made on America[,] Boston especially[,] will in the end prove of real advantage.&#x201d;16<br>This led Madison directly back to the issue of state churches that he had raised with his friend before: &#x201c;If the Church of England had been the established and general Religion in all the Northern Colonies as it has been among us here,&#x201d; he erupted, &#x201c;and uninterrupted tranquility had prevailed throughout the Continent, It is clear to me ...</p><h2>Raising Maidens of Virtue : A Study of Feminine Loveliness for Mothers and Daughters</h2><p>More than a fill-in-the-blank Bible study, Raising Maidens of Virtue is an engaging tool for mothers to use in training daughters who are approaching womanhood to think biblically.

Earlier this year, the remains of a man with a curving spine, who possible was killed in battle, were discovered underneath the paving of a parking lot in Leicester, England. Phillipa Langley, head of The Richard III Society, spurred on by the work of the historian Michael Jones, led the team of who uncovered the remains, certain that she had found the bones of the monarch. When DNA verification later confirmed that the skeleton was, indeed, that of King Richard III, the discovery ranks among the great stories of passionate intuition and perseverance against the odds. The news of the discovery of Richard's remains has been widely reported by the British as well as worldwide and was front page news for both the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>. Many believe that now, with King Richard III's skeleton in hand, historians will finally begin to understand what happened to him following the Battle of Bosworth Field (twenty miles or so from Leicester) and, ultimately, to know whether he was the hateful, unscrupulous monarch of Shakespeare's drama or a much more benevolent king interested in the common man. Written in alternating chapters, with Richard's 15th century life told by historian Michael Jones (author of the critically acclaimed <i>Bosworth - 1485</i>) contrasting with the 21st century eyewitness account of the search and discovery of the body by Philippa Langley, <i>The King's Grave</i> will be both an extraordinary portrait of the last Plantagenet monarch and the inspiring story of the archaeological dig that finally brings the real King Richard III into the light of day.</p></p><p><p>PHILIPPA LANGLEY is a screenwriter and producer who inaugurated and led the successful archaeological search to locate King Richard III's grave in Leicester.

It's a tough, taxing job, and of 5,000 candidates annually, "only four or five made it all the way through probation to full duty."</p><p> In much the same manner as another recent series debut (C.J. Box's topnotch <i>Open Season</i>), Heywood, who has written other novels but has now started the "Woods Cop" mysteries with Grady Service, takes us into the world of men at home in the wilderness. That means both good guys and bad.</p><p> A big problem for the good guys, however, is that the demanding life is tough on those who love them. As Grady tells it, one night his now ex-wife said to him at dinner, "I'd like another helping of cauliflower and a divorce.... You have a death wish and I don't wish to be a young widow." </p><p> When he meets Maridly Nantz, one of the rare female COs, he's found someone tough enough to take him on. But, first, the two of them must figure out what's behind the deliberate fires, flights of mysterious helicopters, and other unexplained but definitely illegal goings-on in the Mosquito Tract, Grady's own special piece of Upper Peninsula turf.</p><p> <i>Ice Hunter</i> (the title gives away more than is immediately obvious) is full of enough atmosphere that you'll definitely want to be in a warm, dry room while reading it. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Meet Grady Service: a former Marine, renowned tracker, Conservation Officer, and the last person any errant hunter wants to cross. In Ice Hunter, the first of a new series of mysteries set in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Service defends his turf with the tenacity of a bear and the wisdom of an ancient. He shuns all creature comforts and consumerism and is most at home stalking the Mosquito Tract, his self-designated wilderness and the land protected by his C.O. father before him. Times are not easy for Service. As this summer season opens, he gets news that his nemesis, the despicable leader of an incestuous clan of poachers, is about to be released from prison. But something even more sinister is afoot in the Mosquito Tract - something that inspires greed far beyond the hunter going over his limit, something that involves giants of industry and politics (including the governor of the State of Michigan) - something that too easily renders human life dispensable. Service must call upon his every reserve to track, stalk, and hunt the "ice" hunter. Full of grit and wilderness lore, Ice Hunter show off Heywood's extraordinary talents Like his four earlier novels, which have gained him cult status for his intricate plots and outrageously unforgettable characters, Ice Hunter delivers and entices with the promise of more novels in the series to come.

Instead of Ir�ne, Jean Cocteau accompanied him. In a vain attempt to set himself at the head of the avant-garde, this ambitious young poet had inveigled Picasso into collaborating with him on </i>Parade:<i> a gimmicky, quasi-modernist ballet about the efforts of a couple of shills to lure the public into their vaudeville theater by tantalizing them with samples of their acts. Cocteau had desperately wanted Diaghilev to stage this ballet in Paris. The meddlesome Polish hostess Misia Sert had tried to scupper the project. However, Picasso's Chilean protector and patron, Eugenia Err�zuriz, had persuaded Diaghilev to agree, provided Picasso did the d�cor, Erik Satie the score, and L�onide Massine the choreography. Sets, costumes, and rehearsals were to be done in Rome, where Diaghilev had his wartime headquarters. Picasso's cubist followers were horrified that their avant-garde hero should desert them for anything as frivolous and modish as the Ballets Russes, but he ignored their complaints. After two and a half years of war, with its appalling death toll, its hardships and shortages, and above all the absence of his closest friends</i>&#x2014;<i>particularly Braque and Apollinaire at the front</i>&#x2014;<i>Picasso was elated at the prospect of leaving the bombardments and blackouts behind to spend a couple of months in the relative peace of Rome, which he had always wanted to visit. Besides working on Parade, he was determined to get married.</i><br>Picasso and Cocteau arrived in Rome on February 19, 1917, a day later than they had intended. Cocteau, who had forgotten to get a visa from the Italian embassy, had lied when telling him that no reservations were available. Diaghilev had booked them into the Grand Hotel de Russie on the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Piazza del Popolo. So that Picasso could work in peace on the costumes and sets for <i>Parade</i>, he had also arranged for him to have one of the coveted Patrizi studios, tucked away in a sprawling, unkempt garden off the Via Margutta. Although most of the artists are now gone, the Patrizi studios are still as idyllic as they were in 1917.<br><br>"I cannot forget Picasso's studio in Rome," Cocteau later wrote. "A small chest contained the maquette for <i>Parade</i>, with its houses, trees and shack. It was there that Picasso did his designs for the Chinese Conjurer, the Managers, the American Girl, the Horse, which Anna de Noailles would compare to a laughing tree, and the Acrobats in blue tights, which would remind Marcel Proust of The <i>Dioscuri</i>."[1] From his window Picasso had a magnificent view of the sixteenth-century Villa Medici, seat of the French Academy, towering above the studio garden. As he well knew, the Academy had associations with some of his favorite artists. Vel�zquez had painted the garden; Ingres had spent four years there as a fellow at the outset of his career and, later, six years as director; Corot had also worked there and caught the golden light of Rome and the <i>campagna</i>, as no other painter had done.<br><br>"Rome seems made by [Corot]," Cocteau reported to his mother. "Picasso talks of nothing else but this master, who touches us much more than Italians hell bent on the grandiose!"[2] That Picasso infinitely preferred the informality of Corot's radiant views to the pomp and ceremony and baroque theatricality of so much Roman painting is confirmed by his sun-filled pointillistic watercolors of the Villa Medici's ochre fa�ade&#x2014;as original as anything he did in Rome.[3]<br><br>Diaghilev insisted that Picasso and Cocteau share his passion for the city. Sightseeing was compulsory that very first evening. Since there was no blackout as there was in Paris, they were able to see the Colosseum all lit up&#x2014;"that enormous reservoir of the centuries," Cocteau said, "which one would like to see come alive, crowded with people and wild beasts and peanut vendors."[4] The following morning, Diaghilev picked them up in his car for another grand tour. In the evening he took them to the circus. "Sad but beautiful arena," Cocteau wrote his mother. "Misia Sert (or rather her double) performed on the tight rope. Diaghilev slept until woken with a start by an elephant putting its feet on his knees."[5]<br><br>When he arrived in Rome, Picasso was still suffering from <i>chagrin d'amour</i>. Eager to find a replacement for Ir�ne Lagut, he had promptly fallen in love with one of Diaghilev's Russian dancers, the twenty-five-year-old Olga Khokhlova. Although he courted her assiduously and did a drawing of her, which he signed with his name in Cyrillic, Olga proved adamantly chaste. Chastity was a challenge that Picasso had seldom had to face. Both Diaghilev and Bakst warned him that a respectable Russian woman would not sacrifice her virginity unless assured of marriage. <i>"Une russe on l'�pouse,"</i> Diaghilev said. Olga personified this view. She was indeed respectable: the daughter of Stepan Vasilievich Khokhlov, who was not a general, as she claimed, but a colonel in the Corps of Engineers in charge of the railway system.[6] Olga had three brothers and a younger sister. They lived in St. Petersburg in a state-owned apartment on the Moika Canal. Around 1910, the colonel had been sent to the Kars region to oversee railroad construction, and the family had followed him there. Olga stayed behind. Egged on by a school friend's sister, Mathilda Konetskaya, who had joined the Diaghilev ballet after graduating from the Imperial Ballet School, she decided to become a dancer.<br><br>Olga had considerable talent. Despite starting late and studying briefly at a St. Petersburg ballet school,[7] she managed to get auditioned by Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes was having difficulty prying dancers loose from the state-run theaters and was desperate for recruits. A committee consisting of Nijinsky and the greatest of classical ballet masters, Enrico Cecchetti, as well as Diaghilev&#x2014;a trio described by another dancer as more terrifying than any first- night audience&#x2014;put Olga through her paces and accepted her. Intelligence and diligence compensated for lack of experience. Nijinsky was sufficiently impressed to pick her out of the corps de ballet.<br><br>L�onide Massine, who had taken Nijinsky's place in Diaghilev's company as well as in his heart, had chosen Olga to play the role of Dorotea in <i>Les Femmes de bonne humeur</i>, an adaptation of a comedy by the eighteenth-century playwright Goldoni, with sets by L�on Bakst and a heavily arranged score after Scarlatti. It was at a rehearsal for this ballet, which would have its premiere in Rome the following month, that Picasso spotted Olga and immediately set about courting her. To familiarize himself with the techniques of theatrical d�cor as well as watch his new love at work, he helped Carlo Socrate (the scene painter who would work on <i>Parade</i>) execute Bakst's scenery. So that he could join Olga backstage, Picasso even helped the stagehands at the ballet's premiere.[8] Eighteen months later he would marry her.<br><br>Compared to her predecessors&#x2014;Bohemian models Picasso had lived with in Montmartre or Montparnasse&#x2014;Olga was very much a lady, not, however, the noblewoman biographers have assumed her to be.[9] She came from much the same professional class as Picasso's family. Don Jos�, Picasso's father, may have been a very unsuccessful painter, but his brothers included a diplomat, a revered prelate, and a successful doctor, who had married the daughter of a Malague�o marquis. One of Picasso's mother's first cousins was a general&#x2014;more celebrated than Olga's parent, also the real thing. Indeed, it may have been Olga's lack of blue blood that made her so anxious to become a grande dame and bring up her son like a little prince. Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, who had met Olga in 1916 when the ballet visited San Sebasti�n, remembered her as "a stupid Russian who liked to brag about her father, who she pretended was a colonel in the Tsar's own regiment. The other dancers assured me that he was only a sergeant."[10] This was an exaggeration, but Olga's pretensions were resented by other members of the company.<br><br>Ten years younger than Picasso, Olga had fine regular features, dark reddish hair, green eyes, a small, lithe, dancer's body, and a look of wistful, Slavic melancholy that accorded with the romanticism of classic Russian ballet. Formal photographs reveal Olga to have been a beauty&#x2014;usually an unsmiling one&#x2014;although in early snapshots of her with Picasso and Cocteau in Rome, she is actually grinning. Later, she plays up to him, dances for him, takes on different personalities, which might explain the widely varying reactions to her. The celebrated ballerina Alexandra Danilova declared that Olga "was <i>nothing</i>&#x2014;nice but nothing. We couldn't discover what Picasso saw in her."[11] A Soviet ballet historian, the late Genya Smakov, found references to her in an unpublished memoir by someone working for Diaghilev, where she is said to have been "neurotic."[12] On the other hand, Lydia Lopokova&#x2014;the most intelligent of Diaghilev's ballerinas&#x2014;was Olga's best friend in the company.<br><br>Picasso fell for Olga's vulnerability. He sensed the victim within. She would have appealed to his possessiveness and protectiveness especially when the Russian Revolution cut her off from her family. Her vulnerability would likewise have appealed to Picasso's sadistic side. (The women in his life were expected to read the Marquis de Sade.) In the past year rejection by the two women he had hoped to marry had left him exceedingly vulnerable. Picasso's residual bourgeois streak should also be taken into account. He was thirty-five and wanted to settle down with a presentable wife and have a son. None of his father's three brothers had had any issue, and there was pressure from his mother to produce an heir.<br><br>Sexual abstinence was something Picasso had seldom if ever had to face. His two previous mistresses may have shied away from marrying him, but they had been easy enough to seduce. Olga was as unbeddable as the "nice" Malague�a girls that his family had tried to foist on him. "Don't forget Olga who cares for you very much," she wrote on the back of a dramatic photograph of herself in <i>Firebird</i>. "Who neglects me, loses me."[13] (Cocteau could not resist using the phrase <i>qui me n�glige me perd</i> as a caption to a caricature of Bakst he subsequently sent to Olga.)[14] Picasso must have been very much in love to put up with this ukase. Ernest Ansermet, Diaghilev's principal conductor, describes walking back to the Hotel Minerva, where he and the dancers were staying. Olga had the room next to Ansermet's. "I heard Picasso in the passage knocking at her door and Olga on the other side of it saying 'No, no, Monsieur Picasso, I'm not going to let you in.' "[15] Clearly, marriage was his only option.<br><br>Diaghilev, who felt responsible for the genteel Russian girls in his company, advised Picasso against marrying Olga. Foreseeing problems with her parents, who were averse to their daughter marrying a mere painter, the impresario told Picasso that he had a much more suitable girl set aside for him. She was currently dancing in South America and would soon be returning to Europe. Picasso would not listen; he was obsessed by Olga. Not that this kept him away from the local brothels, to judge by an address noted down in his Roman sketchbook.[16] "In Rome of an evening," Picasso told Apollinaire, "whores ply their trade in automobiles&#x2014;at walking pace&#x2014;they accost their clients with smiles and gestures and stop the car to negotiate the price."[17] From Naples he would send Apollinaire a postcard: "In Naples all the women are beautiful. Everything is easy here,"[18] and, sure enough, the sketchbook he took with him records the address of a Neapolitan brothel. For an Andalusian, regular visits to a whorehouse would have been an obligatory response to a fianc�e's virtuous stand. Another option was an affair with a less virtuous member of the company. Picasso did that too.[19]<br><br>Cut off by the war from Russia, Diaghilev and his company led a nomadic life. Their principal wartime base was Rome. Officially the impresario stayed in the Grand Hotel, but he spent most of his time in an apartment in the Marchese Theodoli's palazzo on the Corso that he had rented for L�onide Massine, the handsome twenty-one-year-old dancer, who had been his lover for the previous three years. So as not to compromise himself publicly, Massine had insisted that he and his employer live under separate roofs. That this hot-blooded heterosexual, who was also a cold-blooded operator, should have allowed himself to be captured and caged by the notoriously jealous and possessive Diaghilev is not surprising. In Russia it had been a standard career move for a dancer of either sex to have a rich, influential protector. To negotiate these arrangements, one of the company's dancers, Alexandrov, acted as pimp. Massine's predecessor in Diaghilev's life, the legendary Nijinsky, who was likewise heterosexual, had started off&#x2014;with his mother's blessing&#x2014;as the prot�g� of the rich, young Prince Lvov. The Prince had then handed him on to the Polish Count Tishkievitch, who gave him a piano.[20] Like Diaghilev's previous lover, Dimitri Filosofov, Nijinsky would leave the impresario for a woman; as would Massine.<br><br>Exceedingly parsimonious and very ambitious, Massine had everything to gain from this arrangement. Diaghilev had already turned him into a star dancer, a choreographer of near genius and a major collector of modern paintings, including many Picassos and Braques. Sex with Diaghilev was part of the job&#x2014;"like going to bed with a nice fat old lady,"[21] as he told one of his mistresses, when she asked how he could possibly have done it with Diaghilev.<br><br>That Massine was a passionate Hispanophile would prove to be a great bond with Picasso. The previous summer in Madrid, the dancer had agreed to choreograph two ballets with Spanish themes, <i>Las Meninas</i>, which would be put on later in 1917, and <i>Tricorne</i>, which would not appear until 1919. A small, driven, Spanish-looking Russian with enormous eyes&#x2014;in some respects a younger version of Picasso&#x2014;Massine expected the artist to teach him about modern art. He proved so perceptive and imaginative and such a quick learner that over the next ten years he and Picasso would collaborate on four great ballets.<br><br>Another bond between Picasso and Massine was a passion for women&#x2014;a passion that differentiated them from Diaghilev's largely homosexual entourage. Cocteau's presence in Rome made for more pique and intrigue than usual. In the face of Diaghilev's jealousy, Picasso was delighted to provide his fellow womanizer with an alibi for his amorous escapades. After failing to persuade Picasso to spy for him, Diaghilev hired a couple of detectives to take on this job.[22] At the slightest suspicion of infidelity on Massine's part, Diaghilev would have a temper tantrum, attack the furniture with his stick, tear the telephone out of the wall and smash it.<br><b>NOTES</b><br>[1] Jean Cocteau, <i>Oeuvres compl�tes</i>, vol.

Climate change is real and is pushing us toward managing the planet as a whole. Urbanization?half the world?s population now lives in cities, and eighty percent will by midcentury?is altering humanity?s land impact and wealth. And biotechnology is becoming the world?s dominant engineering tool. In light of these changes, Brand suggests that environmentalists are going to have to reverse some longheld opinions and embrace tools that they have traditionally distrusted. Only a radical rethinking of traditional green pieties will allow us to forestall the cataclysmic deterioration of the earth?s resources.<br><br> <i>Whole Earth Discipline</i> shatters a number of myths and presents counterintuitive observations on why cities are actually greener than countryside, how nuclear power is the future of energy, and why genetic engineering is the key to crop and land management. With a combination of scientific rigor and passionate advocacy, Brand shows us exactly where the sources of our dilemmas lie and offers a bold and inventive set of policies and solutions for creating a more sustainable society.<br><br> In the end, says Brand, the environmental movement must become newly responsive to fast-moving science and take up the tools and discipline of engineering. We have to learn how to manage the planet?s global-scale natural infrastructure with as light a touch as possible and as much intervention as necessary.<br><br></p><p><b>STEWART BRAND</b> trained originally as an ecologist. His legendary <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> (1968-1985) won the National Book Award in 1972. Brand, whose previous books include <i>The Media Lab, How Buildings Learn</i>, and <i>The Clock of the Long Now</i>, is president and cofounder of The Long Now Foundation and cofounder of Global Business Network.Brand, co-author of the seminal 1969 <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i>, compiles reflections and lessons learned from more than 40 years as an environmentalist in this clumsy yet compelling attempt to inspire practicable solutions to climate change. Brand haphazardly organizes his manifesto into chapters that address environmental stewardship opportunities, exhorting environmentalists to become fearless about following science; his iconoclastic proposals include transitioning to nuclear energy and ecosystem engineering. Brand believes environmentalists must embrace nuclear energy expansion and other inevitable technological advances, and refreshingly suggests a shift in the environmentalists' dogmatic approach to combating climate change. Rejecting the inflexible message so common in the Green movement, he describes a process of reasonable debate and experimentation. Brand's fresh perspective, approachable writing style and manifest wisdom ultimately convince the reader that the future is not an abyss to be feared but an opportunity for innovative problem solvers to embrace enthusiastically. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is written by the author of &#34;Carrie&#34;, &#34;The Shining&#34; and &#34;The Dark Half&#34;.</p><p>Stephen King is the bestselling author of more than thirty books of which the most recent are THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON and HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.Stephen King stretches this short story into a novella. A young boy gets a mysterious Polaroid camera that only takes pictures of a mean dog. The magic camera is creating a portal so that the mean dog can come to Earth and eat people. The boy stops him. The end. The book is saved by narrator Tim Sample&#39;s relentless efforts to wring suspense from the many scenes that are not suspenseful, just drawn out descriptions of mundane things. Sample speaks urgently at the right times, but sometimes even that--combined with suspenseful music--isn&#39;t enough. King&#39;s novella would benefit from a brutal editor hacking away the nonessentials. It&#39;s one of his lesser works.

He is the author or editor of eleven books, including <i>Secret Missions</i> and <i>Black May</i>. He lives in Gainesville, FL.In 1942 German U-boats sank nearly 400 Allied ships off the East coast of the U.S., threatening to sever Britain's lifeline and cripple U.S. war industry. Gannon, a University of Florida history professor, reveals the appalling degree of unpreparedness and opposition to military intervention on the American side, despite accurate warnings from British intelligence, and traces much of it to the Anglophobia of the chief of naval operations, Admiral Ernest J. King. In an impressive research coup, Gannon located the former skipper and several crew members of one of the U-boats involved in the campaign. Using interviews with these men and former U.S. and British military personnel, and a war diary of the U-123 , Gannon recreates two action-packed patrols and the sinking of 18 Allied ships by that submarine. The book will be of enormous interest to sub warfare buffs.

Organized around the workplace, a deity, a diasporic identity, or a neighborhood, these associations gathered in small face-to-face meetings and provided the principal context for cultic and social interactions for their members. Unlike most other groups, however, about which we have data on their rules of membership, financial management, and organizational hierarchy, we have very little information about early Christ groups.<br><br> Drawing on data about associative practices throughout the ancient world, this innovative study offers new insight into the structure and mission of the early Christ groups. John S. Kloppenborg situates the Christ associations within the broader historical context of the ancient Mediterranean and reveals that they were probably smaller than previously believed and did not have a uniform system of governance, and that the attraction of Christ groups was based more on practice than theological belief.</p><p><b>John S. Kloppenborg</b> is university professor and chair of the Department for the Study of Religion at the University of Toronto. A specialist in Christian origins, he has written extensively on the Synoptic Sayings Gospel (Q) and the parables of Jesus.&#x201c;This exceptionally important book offers a clearer understanding of who the early Christ followers really were, where they came from, and how their way of life eventually evolved into the preferred &#x2018;religion&#x2019; of the Roman Empire.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anders Runesson, author of <i>The Origins of the Synagogue</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;John Kloppenborg employs his unmatched knowledge of Greek and Roman associations to construct the first systematic comparison of these small groups with early Christ assemblies. This is a masterpiece of historical research and a model of comparative method.&#x201d;&#x2014;Larry L. Welborn, author of <i>The Young Against the Old</i><br>&#x201c;Why did early Christian groups organize themselves the way they did? What might have attracted people to them? These are questions John Kloppenborg addresses with exemplary clarity and force of argument.&#x201d;&#x2014;Arjan Zuiderhoek, author of&nbsp;<i>The Ancient City</i><br>&#x201c;This data-rich book is a must-read for those interested in the world of earliest Christianity, providing new understandings of social history and of philology. The reader will learn about the rich, the powerful, the citizen and about the immigrant, the artisan, the laborer, the enslaved, and the poor.&#x201d;&#x2014;Laura Nasrallah, author of <i>Archaeology and the Letters of Paul</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;An impressive achievement and a leap forward for scholarship of early Christianity.

The major topics of the day: terrorism, globalization, immigration, consumerism, the collapse of moral values, and the rivalry of superpowers. The twentieth century was not born in the trenches of the Somme or Passchendaele&#x2014;but rather in the fifteen vertiginous years preceding World War I.<p>In this short span of time, a new world order was emerging in ultimately tragic contradiction to the old. These were the years in which the political and personal repercussions of the Industrial Revolution were felt worldwide: Cities grew like never before as people fled the countryside and their traditional identities; science created new possibilities as well as nightmares; education changed the outlook of millions of people; mass-produced items transformed daily life; industrial laborers demanded a share of political power; and women sought to change their place in society&#x2014;as well as the very fabric of sexual relations.</p><p>From the tremendous hope for a new century embodied in the 1900 World's Fair in Paris to the shattering assassination of a Habsburg archduke in Sarajevo in 1914, historian Philipp Blom chronicles this extraordinary epoch year by year. Prime Ministers and peasants, anarchists and actresses, scientists and psychopaths intermingle on the stage of a new century in this portrait of an opulent, unstable age on the brink of disaster.</p><p>Beautifully written and replete with deftly told anecdotes, <i>The Vertigo Years</i> brings the wonders, horrors, and fears of the early twentieth century vividly to life.</p></p><p><b>Philipp Blom</b> holds a doctorate from Oxford University and is the author of <i>To Have and To Hold</i> and <i>Enlightening the World</i>. He frequently contributes articles to <i>The Financial Times</i>, <i>The Independent</i>, and <i>The Guardian</i> among others. He lives in Vienna.Virginia Woolf famously declared that human character changed in the year 1910; this dizzying survey of European history and culture before WWI elaborates. Historian Blom (<i>Enlightening the World</i>) examines every innovation of the turbulent period that, in his estimate, gave birth to modernity and its discontents. Automobiles, airplanes and electricity gave humans unprecedented speed and power; the explosive growth of industry, cities and consumerism shattered and rebuilt communities; women, moving into schools and workplaces, demanded new rights; mass politics and mass media challenged traditional authority; psychoanalysis and the theory of relativity challenged ideas about humans and about time and space. The panorama is almost too much to take in, especially since Blom rightly complicates the picture by exploring the diverse ways in which different countries experienced these upheavals. His stab at a unifying theme&#x2014;a perceived crisis of masculinity that panicked everyone from Proust to proto-Nazi racists as sex roles changed and a machine-driven, bureaucratic economy made muscle-power and martial virtues obsolete&#x2014;is fruitful, but it only partially illuminates the times. This is a stylish, erudite guide to an age of exhilaration and anxiety that in many ways invented our own.

What minister can forget feeling helpless when conducting his first funeral service - or when calling on grieving family members from his first church? Comforting the Bereaved will help both ministers and concerned lay people give God&#39;s comfort to those who hurt. It deals with death and grief from a biblical and psychological perspective and also offers practical advice to ministers on how to handle the grief situation and the funeral service. Though it is impossible to deal with every delicate situation death can initiate, Comforting the Bereaved seeks to offer help for those situations that occur most. There are also suggested answers to questions people most often ask, and help in preparing funeral messages appropriate to individual circumstances.

Murdoch asked. </p><p> "Because I can <i>feel</i> her," Nikolai said. </p><p> Murdoch adjusted Nikolai's arm, which he'd slung across his shoulders to help his brother walk as they searched. The humans milling all around them merely assumed Nikolai was another drunk. </p><p> <i>Proud Nikolai</i>. He was exhausted from consuming too little blood, his body racked with never-ending need for a mad Valkyrie who delighted in his pain. Nikolai had lost weight, his face turning gaunt, his muscles flagging. </p><p> "Murdoch, when I find her...I want you to trace from here." </p><p> He shook his head. "I'll stay until you've secured her -- " </p><p> "No. Don't want you to...see me." Nikolai's weary gaze darted away from Murdoch's. "I will lose control." </p><p> Which would shame his stalwart older brother as little else could. </p><p> Murdoch couldn't imagine how Nikolai would react when he found Myst. Five years ago, she had <i>blooded</i> Nikolai, as only a Bride could, bringing to life his dead vampire's body. She'd made him breathe, made his heart beat, and stoked his newly reawakened lust with no intention of slaking it. </p><p> That same night, another Valkyrie had shot him through with arrows and still another had mocked his desires. Myst had fled with the two, dooming Nikolai. </p><p> A blooded vampire could only take release for the first time while touching his Bride in some way. If she wasn't available, then he would remain in a state of constant sexual readiness, aching indefinitely. </p><p> Which she well knew. </p><p> "Promise me you'll leave," Nikolai grated. </p><p> At length, Murdoch said, "I will." If Myst was indeed here tonight, it would make sense that there'd be more Valkyrie out on these very streets. More of their deceiving, manipulative, violent kind. "But only to find another one," he added. </p><p> He could capture one and interrogate her about the Lore, the world of not-so-mythical beings he and his brother were now a part of. </p><p> Murdoch's knowledge of the Lore was as limited as that of any of the vampires in their warrior order of Forbearers. Their army consisted mostly of turned humans, and the Lore creatures kept their secrets well guarded from them. </p><p> "Don't underestimate the Valkyrie as I did," Nikolai rasped. "Else suffer as I have." </p><p> He suffered because fate had forced this blooding on Nikolai. <i>As if Nikolai needed another burden.</i> </p><p> The blooding process was what Murdoch detested most about being a vampire, even more than never seeing the sun again. </p><p> Though he'd once been a rake, bedding a new woman each night, Murdoch hoped it never happened to him. To be mystically tied to a single woman sounded hellish, especially to a woman he didn't choose, and one who could spurn him, as Myst had Nikolai. </p><p> The pain had rendered his brother nearly mindless in his pursuit of her. Nikolai wanted retribution, but Murdoch suspected he also simply wanted <i>her</i>. Even after all that she'd done to him. </p><p> "Where will you take her this night?" Murdoch asked. "The mill?" They'd secured an old renovated sugar mill outside the city, staying there instead of the Forbearer castle while they'd scoured these streets. </p><p> Nikolai shook his head. </p><p> "Then back to the castle?" </p><p> When Nikolai didn't answer, Murdoch said, "You wouldn't take her to <i>Blachmount</i>?" The ancient Wroth estate -- where most of their family had died in a single night of sickness and murder. "Why?" </p><p> "Because that's where my Bride belongs." </p><p> Before Murdoch could question his meaning, Nikolai went still, his eyes briefly sliding shut. Then his head swung up toward a rooftop. "It's her." </p><p> Above them, a redhead stood frozen, her lips parting in shock. </p><p> Murdoch had only briefly seen her all those years before, and now he studied the details of her Valkyrie appearance. She had delicate fey features -- pointed ears and high cheekbones -- but he also spied the tell-tale claws and small fangs. </p><p> At the sight of her, Nikolai stood fully, no longer needing Murdoch's aid. <i>"My Myst."</i> </p><p> Her face paled, no doubt at the sight of Nikolai, who now looked like the monster she'd sought to make him. His irises had turned completely black, his fangs descending in his mouth, dripping from thirst. </p><p> Her horrified expression almost made Murdoch pity her, but she deserved no mercy. Which was good, because Nikolai would show her none this night. </p><p> Their pursuit of half a decade was...<i>over</i>. At last. </p><p> Just as Nikolai tensed to trace to her, Murdoch slapped him on the back, then teleported away as he'd promised, disappearing so quickly he went unnoticed in the morass of drunken tourists. Even if they had seen him vanish, the humans would think they'd imagined it. </p><p> Murdoch materialized in a back alley several blocks away, then walked to the Quarter's main thoroughfare, Bourbon Street. As he moved among the crowds, a warm breeze tripped down the street, dissipating the swampy haze and the fumes from food vendor stands. </p><p> Warm. In February. Good hunting weather. </p><p> Yes, Nikolai would be merciless tonight, as would Murdoch. Now all he needed was to find his prey. </p><p> <i>The hunt is on.</i> </p><p> <i>I'm being followed.</i> </p><p> Daniela the Ice Maiden furtively glanced over her shoulder once more. Again she spied nothing out of the ordinary -- tourists milling, witches catcalling to human males -- but Danii couldn't shake the feeling that she was being stalked. </p><p> Which begged the question: what creature would be stupid enough to court a Valkyrie's wrath? </p><p> Maybe she was just spooked by N�x's cryptic remarks tonight. Nucking Futs N�x, her half sister and the Valkyrie soothsayer, often made off-the-wall predictions. But this one continued to replay in Danii's mind. </p><p> <i>"Sad, sad Daniela, the broken doll who wants to be fixed. Tonight she might."</i> </p><p> Because of Danii's pale, freezing skin -- she was part Icere -- she was often likened to a porcelain doll. Well, because of her icy skin and because of what would happen to her if she grew overheated.... </p><p> But a <i>broken</i> doll? What did that mean? And fixed -- for good, for bad? <i>What</i> precisely would be fixed? </p><p> She'd told N�x, "I can't imagine what you're talking about. I'm not broken" -- <i>my lonely existence makes me want to tear my hair out</i> -- "and I don't know how I could be 'fixed.'" </p><p> Perhaps by being able to finally touch another? To feel a man's skin against her own without being burned, instead of constantly fantasizing about it? </p><p> <i>I would give anything.</i> </p><p> Yet the only males on earth who could touch her were the Icere. Regrettably, they also happened to want her dead. </p><p> Which meant the closest she'd ever get to having sex would be reading about it in the many tomes of erotica she kept hidden in her room or by indulging in her rich fantasy life. Which also meant she was probably the world's oldest virgin. Merely awaiting confirmation from Guinness. </p><p> <i>And people wonder why I prefer fantasy to reality.</i> </p><p> Her ears twitched with awareness. No, she wasn't simply spooked; <i>something</i> was happening. Her senses were alert. </p><p> Hastening her pace, she carefully wound around the people on the street, negotiating the ninety-eight-point-six degree gauntlet. Even the briefest contact with another's skin would burn her. A conundrum, because she kept cool by baring <i>lots</i> of hers. </p><p> When her frosty breath fogged in the warm night air, she just stifled the urge to scream, and peeked over her shoulder once more. </p><p> This time she spotted a towering male, far behind her. He was striking, looked to be mid-thirties. But there was something unusual about him. </p><p> Was he even human? New Orleans was chock-full of Lore beings. He could be an immortal, maybe even the one trailing her. </p><p> At that moment, he wasn't looking in her direction, so she took the opportunity to duck into an alley beside a hotel. Leaping up four stories to the hotel's flat roof, she crossed to a low ledge wall overlooking the street, then crouched between two flags -- one had a fleur-de-lis covered in beads, and the other said <i>Pardi Gras!</i> </p><p> Tilting her head, she studied the male below. He had longish dark brown hair, cut negligently, with a lock falling over his forehead. His face was fantasy-worthy, with a strong, masculine jaw and chin. </p><p> He wore tasteful clothes, a black button-down and jeans with a jacket that made her feel warm just looking at it. She herself was wearing the thinnest backless dress she could find. </p><p> He strode with an air of confidence. The male was gorgeous -- and he knew it. How could he not, with the women gaping at him? Then she frowned. He seemed oblivious to the prancing coeds in low-cut tops angling for his attention. </p><p> His body was big, muscular in a way that hinted at immortal, but what he was exactly eluded her. Considering his size, he was probably a demon, or even a Lykae -- those animals had begun prowling the Valkyries' turf as bold as they pleased. </p><p> Or could he be...a vampire? </p><p> She trained her gaze on his chest, watching for the rise and fall of breaths. Seconds passed. Historically, the vampires had shunned Louisiana. Yet on this night her Valkyrie coven had heard that members of both warring vampire armies, the Horde and the Forbearers, could be out in the Quarter. </p><p> What they didn't know was why. </p><p> <i>His chest is still.</i> Bingo. Vamp. </p><p> Since his eyes were a normal gray and clear -- not crazed and red with bloodlust -- that meant he was a Forbearer, one of an army who didn't drink blood straight from the flesh. </p><p> Vampires who didn't kill. At least, that was their mission statement. </p><p> The Lore was still waiting to see how that worked out for them. </p><p> Though Danii knew she needed to report back on this si...</p></p><h2>To Have and To Hold (Victorian Trilogy)</h2><p>After spending years in prison for a crime she did not commit, Rachel Wade accepts the proposal of cynical Sebastian Verlaine, Viscount D&#39;Aubrey, who offers her parole in exchange for becoming his mistress. Original.</p><p>After spending ten years in prison for killing her husband, the newly released Rachel Wade is picked up for vagrancy and brought before the magistrate, Sebastian Verlaine, Viscount D'Aubrey. Bored, debauched, selfish and quite willing to admit it, Sebastian is intrigued by Rachel, who seems old beyond her years and beaten by the world. From the first, Sebastian admits that his attraction for Rachel has something a bit perverse about it?an odd theme that runs the length of this romance set in 19th-century England. To save Rachel from another jail term, he hires her as his housekeeper, a position, everyone assumes, that includes more intimate duties. After it becomes obvious that Rachel suffered at the hands of her husband, Sebastian continues to force Rachel to submit to his own selfish desires. Gaffney tries to justify this by the fact that he wants only "to give her pleasure," while her dead husband had found "pleasure in giving her pain." The explanation is not enough to take the bad taste from one's mouth, nor does it help endear a hero who in one scene allows his jaded London friends to spend an amusing evening in tormenting Rachel about her past. Gaffney may have written a different kind of romance, but it is also unsavory.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Blood of an Englishman: An Agatha Raisin Mystery (Agatha Raisin Mysteries)</h2><p><p><i>The Blood of an Englishman</i> continues the tradition in M.

Born in Scotland, she currently divides her time between the English Cotswolds and Paris.<p><i>Chapter One</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fee, fie, fo, fum. I smell the blood of an Englishman.&#x201d;</p> <p>As the giant ogre in the Winter Parva pantomime strutted across the stage, uttering the old familiar words, Agatha Raisin stifled a yawn. She loathed amateur dramatics, but had been persuaded to support the pantomime by her friend, Mrs. Bloxby, the vicar&#x2019;s wife. The two women were in odd contrast: Agatha with her smart clothes and glossy brown hair, Mrs. Bloxby in faded tweeds and wispy brown hair streaked with grey surrounding her gentle face.</p> <p>Agatha began to feel sulky and trapped. Why was she, a private detective of some fame, wasting her sweetness on the desert air of the Winter Parva village hall?</p> <p>The pantomime was <i>Babes in the Woods,</i> but there were also characters from other pantomimes from <i>Old Mother Hubbard</i> to <i>Puss in Boots.</i></p> <p>At last the interval arrived. There was no theatre bar but mulled wine was being served in the entrance hall. Agatha grabbed a glass and said, &#x201c;Going outside for a cigarette.&#x201d;</p> <p>Fog lay heavily on the car park and water dripped mournfully from the trees surrounding it. &#x201c;Still smoking? Dear me,&#x201d; said a voice behind Agatha. She swung round and found herself looking down at the gossip of her home village, Carsely, Mrs. Arnold.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Agatha curtly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you know that only twenty percent of the people in Britain now smoke?&#x201d; said Mrs. Arnold.</p> <p>&#x201c;I never believe in statistics,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;Have they asked everyone?&#x201d; She surveyed Mrs. Arnold&#x2019;s small round figure. &#x201c;Anyway, what about overeating? What about a ban on <i>fat</i> people?&#x201d;</p> <p>A tall man loomed up out of the mist. &#x201c;What do you think of the show?&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha bit back the word <i>hellish</i> that had risen to her lips and said instead, &#x201c;I think the chap playing the ogre is very good. Who is he?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our local baker, Bert Simple. I haven&#x2019;t introduced myself. I recognise you. I&#x2019;m Gareth Craven, producer of the show. That&#x2019;s the end of the interval. I&#x2019;d better get backstage.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Agatha Raisin,&#x201d; Agatha called after him.</p> <p>Quite tasty, thought Agatha, watching his tall figure disappear into the fog. Well, hullo hormones, I thought you had laid down and died.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>She shuffled along her seat beside Mrs. Bloxby. The hall smelled of damp people, mulled wine, and chocolates. A surprising number had brought boxes of chocolates. Pen lights flickered, voices murmured things like, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a hard one. Are those liqueur chocolates, you naughty man!&#x201d; Children, used to slumping on comfortable sofas in front of the television, screamed and hit each other.</p> <p>The curtains were drawn back and the comedian came on. &#x201c;Hullo, hullo, hullo!&#x201d; he yelled.</p> <p>&#x201c;Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,&#x201d; muttered Agatha.</p> <p>The comedian was a local man, George Southern, who owned a gift shop in the village.</p> <p>He was slightly built and rather camp with thin brown hair and a large nose which overshadowed his small mouth.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re in good voice tonight, folks,&#x201d; he said. A screen came down behind him. It&#x2019;s the compulsory sing-along, thought Agatha bleakly.</p> <p>Sure enough. The words of &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Long Way to Tipperary&#x201d; appeared on the screen. Why an old First World War song, wondered Agatha, and then came to the conclusion that they were possibly frightened that anything more modern would incur royalties. From previous experience, she knew that amateur dramatic companies seemed to think the eyes of the world were on them. It seemed to go on forever. He got the men to sing, then the women, then the children. &#x201c;Follow the bouncing ball,&#x201d; he yelled, strutting about the stage in his moment of glory.</p> <p>The curtains were drawn again and opened to reveal a cardboard cottage. The Babes were played by two ill-favoured children, who turned out to be the son and daughter of the head of the parish council, which was why they had landed the parts.</p> <p>&#x201c;Here comes the ogre again,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there supposed to be a witch?&#x201d; said Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;Shhh!&#x201d; admonished a voice behind them.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fee! Fie! Fo! Fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman,&#x201d; roared Bert. &#x201c;Be he alive, or be he dead, I&#x2019;ll grind his bones to make my bread.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was a burly man with a big round head and small glittering eyes, wearing built-up boots to make him look like a giant.</p> <p>Slowly descending on a creaking wire came the Good Fairy. It broke when she was nearly down and she fell on a heap on the stage. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you bloody bastards do anything properly?&#x201d; she yelled. The children whistled and cheered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Shame!&#x201d; called a voice from the audience. &#x201c;Remember the children.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Good Fairy rallied, picked up her bent wand and faced the ogre. &#x201c;I am banishing you to the pit from whence you came,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>There was an impressive puff of green smoke. A trapdoor opened and Bert disappeared. The small orchestra started to play a jolly tune. A chorus lineup of ill-assorted tap dancers thudded their way across the stage. The pantomime dragged on to the close. At the final curtain, there was no sign of Bert.</p> <p>&#x201c;It was all right, considering it was an amateur show,&#x201d; ventured Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>Agatha bit back the nasty remark that was rising to her lips. The two women had come in their separate cars. She said goodnight to her friend, warning her to drive carefully, because the fog was even thicker.</p> <p>As Agatha was nearing Carsely, police cars heading for Winter Parva raced past on the other side of the road. Agatha did a U-turn and followed them. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s up,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Maybe someone&#x2019;s murdered that dreadful comedian.&#x201d;</p> <p>Soon she could see flashing blue lights outside the village hall.</p> <p>The thick mist meant she was able to get into the car park before the police taped off the area. Where was the stage door? That chap, Gareth, had left and gone round the side of the building.</p> <p>She walked round the side of the building and found a small door, standing open. A policeman supporting Gareth Craven came along a corridor inside. &#x201c;If I could just get some fresh air,&#x201d; said Gareth. His face was chalk white.</p> <p>Agatha stepped boldly forward. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a friend of Mr. Craven,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look after him. You can come out when you&#x2019;re ready and take a statement. I have a Peugeot parked outside.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mrs. Bloxby,&#x201d; said Agatha, fearing that the sound of her own name would alert the policeman to the fact that she was a private detective.</p> <p>&#x201c;Registration number of your car?&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha gave it to him and then put an arm around Gareth&#x2019;s waist. &#x201c;Come along,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve some brandy in the car.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I thought you were Agatha Raisin,&#x201d; said Gareth.</p> <p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; said Agatha, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t want that policeman to know that. Here we are. In you go and I&#x2019;ll get the heater on.&#x201d;</p> <p>Once Gareth was settled in the passenger seat and had taken a few swigs of brandy from a flask Agatha kept in the car, Agatha said, &#x201c;What happened in there?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It was awful,&#x201d; said Gareth. &#x201c;When Bert didn&#x2019;t appear for the curtain call, I went back to look for him. He wasn&#x2019;t in any of the dressing rooms. I went down under the platform and there he was. Oh, God!&#x201d;</p> <p>He buried his face in his hands. Agatha waited until she thought he had recovered and said, &#x201c;Go on. What happened to him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He was standing there, very still, his mouth opened in a sort of awful silent scream. There was a big pool of blood at his feet. I couldn&#x2019;t find a pulse. I ran upstairs and phoned police, ambulance and fire brigade. The lot. I couldn&#x2019;t bear any more. That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p> <p>There was a peremptory rap on the car window. Agatha lowered it and found Detective Sergeant Bill Wong staring accusingly at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll speak to you later,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Mr. Craven. Please come with me. We need a statement. And Mrs. Raisin, please drive your car beyond the taped-off police area.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bill must be really cross to call me Mrs. Raisin, thought Agatha. The young detective was the first friend she ever made when she came to the Cotswolds.</p> <p>She decided to drive home and wait for the news the following day. Whatever had happened to Bert, it would be too late for the morning papers, but there might be something on television. But if it were an accident, then nothing would appear at all.</p> <p>She was to get the news from an unexpected quarter.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The following day was Sunday. Agatha contemplated making one of her rare visits to morning service, thought better of it, turned over and went back to sleep.</p> <p>She did not get up until midday. She rose, dressed and went down to feed her cats, Hodge and Boswell, and let them out into the garden. An icy wind was blowing. Both cats turned on the threshold and looked up at her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; urged Agatha. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got fur coats on, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Just then, the front doorbell rang. When Agatha opened the door, it was to find a tired-looking Mrs. Bloxby on the step.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s awful,&#x201d; said the vicar&#x2019;s wife.</p> <p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the coffee on.&#x201d;</p> <p>She waited until her friend was seated at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee, and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been out a good part of last night. Mrs. Simple was in a terrible state. She asked to speak to Alf.&#x201d; Alf was the vicar. &#x201c;We both went to Winter Parva. The doctor had been called and had given Mrs. Simple a tranquilliser but she was still in a state. She said God was punishing her for being a bad wife.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was Bert&#x2019;s death murder? Was she saying she killed him?&#x201d; asked Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, not at all. But it appears to have been a particularly vicious murder. And well thought out, too. A small square had been cut out of the elevator platform. Evidently it always descended a bit too quickly and landed with a bump. Well, when Mr. Simple descended, a long steel spike had been embedded in the floor so that it went up through the hole in the platform, right between his legs and up into his body. Alf and I managed to persuade Mrs. Simple to go to bed and we sat and talked quietly to her until she fell asleep.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t Winter Parva have a vicar?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, Alf takes services there twice a month.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wait a bit,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get this. How on earth would anyone have time to fix that spike and not be discovered?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Simple was killed the first time he descended. That was towards the end of the pantomime. Evidently he had been complaining about the speed it went down and said he would only do it the once.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But there would be a dress rehearsal!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I suppose so. His son, Walt, told us that no one goes down there except the blacksmith.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do we have blacksmiths in this day and age?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, of course. We have three hunts around here. And Mr. Crosswith, the blacksmith, also does wrought-iron gates and things. Bert had been complaining that the trap was a bit dangerous. Mr. Crosswith designed a star trap from some old Victorian drawings.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What is a star trap?&#x201d; asked Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;Star traps consist of a permanent stage floor, made up of several triangular sections of flooring meeting at the centre, which may be lifted but which naturally fall flat. Under the stage is an elevator using counterweights that are heavier than the weight of the performer.</p> <p>&#x201c;To make an impressive entrance, the elevator platform is first lowered, at which point a brake is applied, to stop the counterweight falling. The performer steps onto the platform. On cue, the brake is removed allowing the counterweights to fall. The performer is thrust through the star trapdoor. When the platform hits the highest point the performer leaps upward clearing the trapdoor sections, which then fall back into position at floor level. With a puff of smoke, the illusion is complete. Then in reverse, the flats open and Mr. Simple descends. Do you understand all that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; said Agatha cautiously. &#x201c;How do you know all this?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The Mothers&#x2019; Union was given a tour of the hall earlier this year to show how it had been used back in the Victorian days. The blacksmith gave us a lecture on the trap.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you think someone tampered with the brakes so that the platform would go down extra fast?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe. But it went down pretty fast anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How does anyone get in under the stage? Is there an outside door?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You can get through under the platform at the front. I know that. But whether there is another entrance, I can&#x2019;t say. I know Bert only made one entrance through the trap, so it could have been tampered with any time earlier.&#x201d;</p> <p>Agatha lit a cigarette and watched the smoke drift up towards the kitchen ceiling. &#x201c;Wait a minute. In order for Bert to disappear, someone below the stage must have operated the elevator.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I gather that the stage manager pressed a button at the side of the stage, which opened the trap and sent the green smoke up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But the stage manager&#x2014;or Gareth Craven, the producer&#x2014;surely checked on the apparatus before the show.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If things went all right at the dress rehearsal, Mrs. Raisin, maybe a check wasn&#x2019;t considered necessary,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>We really should start to call each other by our first names, thought Agatha. We called each other by our second names in the Ladies Society. But the society is long gone.</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the spike, or whatever it was that killed Bert?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that. Someone must have really hated him,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby. &#x201c;Such an elaborate way of killing him!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The blacksmith must be the obvious culprit,&#x201d; said Agatha.</p> <p>&#x201c;I believe he is a quiet, sensitive man,&#x201d; said Mrs. Bloxby.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, well,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to leave this one to the police. I&#x2019;ve got my own business to run and I can&#x2019;t see anyone in Winter Parva wanting to pay me to investigate the murder of a baker.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>On a Monday morning, a week later, Agatha, as usual, greeted her staff before settling down to have her usual breakfast at her desk&#x2014;one cup of strong black coffee and two cigarettes. Her staff consisted of young, blond and beautiful Toni Gilmour; white-haired gentle Phil Marshall; lugubrious ex-policeman Patrick Mulligan; young Simon Black with his jester&#x2019;s face; and secretary, Mrs. Freedman. Simon had left briefly to work for another agency when he thought Toni had resigned. But when he heard Toni had returned, he had promptly asked for his job back. Agatha did not like Simon much, but had rehired him in a weak moment.</p> <p>Agatha blew out a smoke ring. Mrs. Freedman gave an admonitory cough and switched on an extractor fan she had insisted on having installed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;Toni and Simon, you have Mrs. Fairly&#x2019;s case. She wants proof of her husband&#x2019;s infidelity. Phil and Patrick, you&#x2019;ve got two missing teenagers. You&#x2019;ve got their details and photographs?&#x201d;</p> <p>Both nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Agatha. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got Berry&#x2019;s supermarket. Valuable goods have been disappearing from their electronics section and so far there&#x2019;s been nothing on their CCTV cameras. I&#x2019;m going to spend the day there.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; said Toni. &#x201c;Might be something interesting.&#x201d; Toni hoped it might be a job that she could do on her own. She did not like working with Simon. He was constantly asking her out on dates and she found it all embarrassing.</p> <p>The door opened and a man Agatha recognised as Gareth Craven walked in. He was even better looking than Agatha remembered. She did a frantic mental check. Did she have coffee-stained teeth? Had her lipstick faded? Why had she opted for trousers and flat shoes?</p> <p>Gareth Craven was a tall man with thick brown hair, clear grey eye...</p></p><h2>Snow in August</h2><p>An unlikely friendship between an eleven-year-old Irish Catholic boy and a lonely rabbi from Prague in 1947 Brooklyn has the two opening new windows of understanding with each other but still fighting the prejudices of the day</p><p>In 1940s Brooklyn, friendship between an 11-year-old Irish Catholic boy and an elderly Jewish rabbi might seem as unlikely as, well, snow in August. But the relationship between young Michael Devlin and Rabbi Judah Hirsch is only one of the many miracles large and small contained in Pete Hamill's novel. Michael finds himself in trouble when he witnesses the 17-year-old leader of the dreaded Falcons gang beating an elderly shopkeeper. For Michael, 1940s Brooklyn is a world still shaped by life in the Old Country, a world where informing on a fellow Irishman is the worst crime imaginable--worse even than the violent crimes committed by some of those fellows. So Michael keeps silent, finding solace in the company of Rabbi Hirsch, a Czech refuge whom he meets by chance. From this serendipitous beginning blossoms a unique friendship--one that proves perilous to both when the Falcons catch up with them. <p> Interlaced with Hamill's realistic descriptions of violence and fear are scenes of remarkable poignancy: the rabbi's first baseball game, where he sees Jackie Robinson play for the Dodgers; Michael's introduction into the mystical world of the Cabbala and the book's miraculous ending. Hamill is not a lyrical writer, but he is a heartfelt one, and this story of courage in the face of great odds is one of his best.</p>Pete Hamill is current editor in chief of the New York Daily News.</p><h2>Fingerprints of the Gods: The Evidence of Earth&#39;s Lost Civilization</h2><p>The bestselling author of The Sign and the Seal reveals the true origins of civilization.

Only at the end, when I watched the inglorious collapse and the obstinacy of his final downfall, was I able suddenly to fit together the bits of mosaic I had been amassing for twelve years into a complete picture of his opaque and sphinx like personality. If my contemporaries fail to understand me, those who came after will surely profit from this account.&#x201d;</i> Otto Dietrich<br><br> When Otto Dietrich was invited in 1933 to become Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s press chief, he accepted with the simple uncritical conviction that Adolf Hitler was a great man, dedicated to promoting peace and welfare for the German people. At the end of the war, imprisoned and disillusioned, Otto Dietrich sat down to write what he had seen and heard in twelve years of the closest association with Hitler, requesting that it be published after his death.<br><br> Dietrich&#x2019;s role placed him in a privileged position. He was hired by Hitler in 1933, was his confidant until 1945, and he worked and clashed with Joseph Goebbels. His direct, personal experience of life at the heat of the Reich makes for compelling reading.</p><p><strong>Otto Dietrich</strong> was the Third Reich&#x2019;s press chief from 1933 to 1945. He was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to seven years in prison, where he wrote his memoirs. He died in 1952 at the age of fifty-five.<br><br><strong>Roger Moorhouse</strong> is a leading expert on the Third Reich and is the author of <em>Killing Hitler: The Third Reich and the Plots against the Fu&#x308;hrer</em>.A member of Hitler&#39;s staff who monitored foreign press for the dictator, Dietrich began this memoir within months of Nazi Germany&#39;s defeat. The audience clearly on Dietrich&#39;s mind was the German people, to whom, as a Hitler associate, he felt obligated to offer an explanation of the author of their trauma in 1945. There are sound reasons why Dietrich&#39;s recollections (which were originally published in the 1950s; this is the first American edition) never became as well known as Albert Speer&#39;s Inside the Third Reich (1970). Long on philosophy and anecdotes, Dietrich&#39;s narrative and factual utility to a historian would be limited. Nevertheless, his character observations accord with historian Ian Kershaw&#39;s biography and so may engage general interest in what Hitler&#39;s haunts and habits were like. Amid details about physical surroundings, Dietrich imparts the tedium of listening to Hitler&#39;s repetitive nocturnal monologues, from which palaver Dietrich theorizes a dual personality of superficial affability concealing aggressive willfulness. However postwar Germans reacted to Dietrich&#39;s portrait, his work shows present readers an insider&#39;s first-draft exegesis of Hitler. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>National Theatre Play In A Box</h2><p>Discover how to create, direct and act in your very own play in this brilliant kit from the National Theatre.

He has found it in Mr. Anderson of British Intelligence.Bruno&#39;s African upbringing, and fluency in numerous African languages, has made him a top interpreter in London, useful to businesses, hospitals, diplomats-and spies. Working for Anderson in a clandestine facility known as the &#34;Chat Room,&#34; Salvo (as he&#39;s known) translates intercepted phone calls, bugged recordings, snatched voice mail messages. When Anderson sends him to a mysterious island to interpret during a secret conference between Central African warlords, Bruno thinks he is helping Britain bring peace to a bloody corner of the world. But then he hears something he should not have....Building upon the box office success of le Carre&#39;s The Constant Gardener (like THE MISSION SONG, built around turmoil and conspiracy in Africa) and le Carre&#39;s laser eye for the complexity of the modern world (seen in Absolute Friends&#39; prediction that the Iraq war would be based on phony and manipulated intelligence), this new novel is a crowning achievement, full of politics, heart, and the sort of suspense that nobody in the world does better.</p><p>John le Carr� is the author of numerous classic, bestselling novels, including Absolute Friends, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, The Little Drummer Girl, and The Constant Gardener. He lives in Cornwall, England.The unchallenged master of the contemporary spy novel turns his attention to the Dark Continent. Bruno "Salvo" Salvador, son of an Irish missionary and a Congolese woman, straddles both worlds as an interpreter of minority African languages, who is married to an aristocratic British journalist and passionately involved with a Congolese nurse. Salvo is hired to be the interpreter for a secret meeting between central African leaders and a mining syndicate. Unfortunately, he hears more than he should about the fate of the Congo--knowledge that could kill him. Award-winning British actor David Oyelowo has the perfect voice--smooth, rich, almost hypnotic in timbre and emotion--to tell this cloak-and-dagger tale. A minor le Carr&#x17d;, but read by a master.

Touched by echoes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, <i>Nobody Move</i> is at once an homage to and a variation on literary form. It salutes one of our most enduring and popular genres&#x2015;the American crime novel&#x2015;but with a grisly humor and outrageousness that are Denis Johnson's own. Sexy, suspenseful, and above all entertaining, <i>Nobody Move</i> shows one of our greatest novelists at his versatile best.</p></p><p><b>Denis Johnson (1949-2017)</b> is the author of eight novels, one novella, one book of short stories, three collections of poetry, two collections of plays, and one book of reportage. His novel <i>Tree of Smoke</i> won the 2007 National Book Award.There&#39;s no shortage of tough guys and girls in Denis Johnson&#39;s NOBODY MOVE. There&#39;s also no real hero in the book, just bad guys and worse ones, all of them pretty interesting. Will Patton gives real character to all the players, especially the protagonist, a gambling-addicted singer in a barbershop choir named Johnny Lutz. The guy has no idea how much trouble he&#39;s in until the cold-blooded enforcer, Ernest Gambol, takes him for a one-way ride into the California countryside. Patton&#39;s Gambol is seriously sinister--you can almost hear creepy music in the background. Throw in a beautiful woman, $2.3 million, blood, guns, and revenge--and you&#39;ve got a contemporary crime noir masterpiece. Patton and Johnson make it all seem brand new.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen&#39;s popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called eventyr in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality. Andersen&#39;s fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages,[1] have become culturally embedded in the West&#39;s collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.[2] Some of his most famous fairy tales include Thumbelina, &#34;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#34;, &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34;, &#34;The Nightingale&#34;, &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;, &#34;The Ugly Duckling&#34;, &#34;Thumbelina&#34;, and many more. His stories have inspired ballets, animated and live-action films, and plays. About the Artist: Lin Utzon is a qualified art-craft worker and textile designer. Her art is wide-ranging and extends from bone china collections for Rosendahl and Royal Copenhagen, to scenography and costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet, architectural embellishments for J�rn Utzon s church in Bagsv�rd and Volvo s headquarters in Gothenburg, among others. Her poetic style is often inspired by nature and there is a distinct Northern flavor to all her works of art.Once upon a time there was a woman whose only desire was to have a tiny little child.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she had no idea where she could get one, so she went to an old witch and asked her: "Please, could you tell me where I could get a tiny little child?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would so love to have one."<br><br>"That is not so difficult," said the witch.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is a grain of barley; it is not the kind that grows in the farmer's fields or that you can feed to the chickens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant it in a flowerpot and watch what happens."<br>Excerpted from <i>Thumbelina</i> by Hans Christian Andersen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation copyright (c) 1974 by Erik Haugaard.

Her mother was a musician; the house was filled with her parents' friends: artists, writers, and musicians. "Their lives were very full and they didn't really have time for a child," she says. "So I turned to writing to amuse myself."<br><br>When she was 12, Ms. L'Engle moved with her family to the French Alps in search of purer air for her father's lungs. She was sent to an English boarding school --"dreadful," she says. When she was 14, her family returned to America and she went to boarding school once again, Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina--which she loved. When she was 17, her father died.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle spent the next four years at Smith College. After graduating cum laude, she and an assortment of friends moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village. "I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world." Mr. Franklin resumed acting, and became well known as Dr. Charles Tyler in the television series <i>All My Children.</i> <i>Two-Part Invention</i> is Ms. L'Engle's touching and critically acclaimed story of their long and loving marriage. <br><br>The Time quintet--<i>A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters,</i> and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>--are among her most famous books, but it took years to get a publisher to accept <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i> "Every major publisher turned it down. No one knew what to do with it," she says. When Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux finally accepted the manuscript, she insisted that they publish it as a children's book. It was the beginning of their children's list."<br><br>Today, Ms. L'Engle lives in New York City and Connecticut, writing at home and at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where she is variously the librarian and the writer-in-residence. "It depends from day-to-day on what they want to call me. I do keep the library collection--largely theology, philosophy, a lot of good reference books--open on a volunteer basis."<br><b>Author Fun Facts<br><br></b><i>Born<br></i>November 29 in New York City<br><br><i>Education<br></i>Smith College, The New School, Columbia University<br><br><i>Currently lives<br></i>New York City and Connecticut<br><br><i>Fun Jobs<br></i>Librarian, actress<br><br><i>Favorite...<br></i>...hobbies: traveling, reading, playing the piano, and cooking<br><b>A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"</b>I wrote my first story when I was 5. It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when t...</p><h2>Cotton Country Collection</h2><p>The Cotton Country Collection is a classic among southern cookbook.

With nothing but their grief and each other against the awesome power of the Reich, they launch a simple, clandestine resistance campaign that soon has an enraged Gestapo on their trail, and a world of terrified neighbors and cynical snitches ready to turn them in.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the end, it&#x2019;s more than an edge-of-your-seat thriller, more than a moving romance, even more than literature of the highest order&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a deeply stirring story of two people standing up for what&#x2019;s right, and for each other.</p><p>Before WWII , German writer Hans Fallada&#x2019;s novels were international bestsellers, on a par with those of his countrymen Thomas Mann and Herman Hesse. In America, Hollywood even turned his first big novel, <i>Little Man, What Now?</i> into a major motion picture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Learning the movie was made by a Jewish producer, however, Hitler decreed Fallada&#x2019;s work could no longer be sold outside Germany, and the rising Nazis began to pay him closer attention. When he refused to join the Nazi party he was arrested by the Gestapo&#x2014;who eventually released him, but thereafter regularly summoned him for &#x201c;discussions&#x201d; of his work.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, unlike Mann, Hesse, and others, Fallada refused to flee to safety, even when his British publisher, George Putnam, sent a private boat to rescue him. The pressure took its toll on Fallada, and he resorted increasingly to drugs and alcohol for relief. After Goebbels ordered him to write an anti-Semitic novel, he snapped and found himself imprisoned in an asylum for the &#x201c;criminally insane&#x201d;&#x2014;considered a death sentence under Nazi rule. To forestall the inevitable, he pretended to write the assignment for Goebbels, while actually composing<br> three encrypted books&#x2014;including his tour de force novel <i>The Drinker</i>&#x2014;in such dense code that they were not deciphered until long after his death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fallada outlasted the Reich and was freed at war&#x2019;s end. But he was a shattered man. To help him recover by putting him to work, Fallada&#x2019;s publisher gave him the Gestapo file of a simple, working-class couple who had resisted the Nazis. Inspired, Fallada completed <i>Every Man Dies Alone</i> in just twenty-four days.<br> &nbsp;<br> He died in February 1947, just weeks before the book&#x2019;s publication.<b>Chapter One</b><br> <b>Some Bad News</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The postwoman Eva Kluge slowly climbs the steps of 55 Jablonski Strasse. She&#x2019;s tired from her round, but she also has one of those letters in her bag that she hates to deliver, and is about to have to deliver, to the Quangels, on the second floor.<br> Before that, on the floor below, she has a Party circular for the Persickes. Persicke is some political functionary or other &#x2014; Eva Kluge always gets the titles mixed up. At any rate, she has to remember to call out &#x201c;Heil Hitler!&#x201d; at the Persickes&#x2019; and watch her lip. Which she needs to do anyway, there&#x2019;s not many people to whom Eva Kluge can say what she thinks. Not that she&#x2019;s a political animal, she&#x2019;s just an ordinary woman, but as a woman she&#x2019;s of the view that you don&#x2019;t put children in the world to have them shot. Also, that a home without a man is no good, and for the time being she&#x2019;s got nothing: not her two boys, not a man, not a proper home. So, she has to keep her lip buttoned, and deliver horrible field letters that aren&#x2019;t written but typed, and are signed &#x2018;Regimental Adjutant&#x2019;.<br> She rings the bell at the Persickes&#x2019;, says &#x201c;Heil Hitler!&#x201d; and hands the old drunk his circular. He has his party badge on his lapel, and he asks: &#x2018;Well, so what&#x2019;s new?&#x2019;<br> She replies: &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you heard the special report? France has capitulated.&#x201d;<br> Persicke&#x2019;s not content with that. &#x201c;Come on, Miss, of course I knew that; but to hear you say it, it&#x2019;s like you were selling stale rolls. Say it like it meant something! It&#x2019;s your job to tell everyone who doesn&#x2019;t have a radio, and convince the last of the moaners. The second Blitzkrieg is in the bag now, it&#x2019;s England now! In another three months, the Tommies will be finished, and then we&#x2019;ll see what the Fuhrer has in store for us. Then it&#x2019;ll be the turn of the others to bleed, and we&#x2019;ll be the masters. Come on in, and have a schnapps with us. Amalie, Erna, August, Adolf, Baldur &#x2014; let&#x2019;s be having you. Today we&#x2019;re celebrating, we&#x2019;re not working today. Today we&#x2019;ll wet the news, and in the afternoon we&#x2019;ll go and pay a call on the Jewish lady on the fourth floor, and see if she won&#x2019;t treat us to coffee and cake! I tell you, there&#x2019;ll be no mercy for that bitch any more!&#x201d;<br> While Mr. Persicke, ringed by his family launches into increasingly wild vituperative and starts hitting the schnapps, the postie has climbed another flight of stairs and rung the Quangels&#x2019; bell. She&#x2019;s already holding the letter out in her hand, ready to run off the second she&#x2019;s handed it over. And she&#x2019;s in luck: it&#x2019;s not the woman who answers the door &#x2014; she usually likes to exchange a few pleasantries &#x2014; but the man with the etched, birdlike face, the thin lips, and the cold eyes. He takes the letter out of her hand without a word and pushes the door shut in her face, as if she was a thief, someone you had to be on your guard against.<br> Eva Kluge shrugs her shoulders and turns to go back downstairs. Some people are like that; in all the time she&#x2019;s delivered mail in the Jablonski Strasse, that man has yet to say a single word to her. Well, let him be, she can&#x2019;t change him, she couldn&#x2019;t even change the man she&#x2019;s married to, who wastes his money sitting in bars and betting on horses, and only ever shows his face at home when he&#x2019;s skint.<br> At the Persickes&#x2019; they&#x2019;ve left the apartment door open, she can hear the glasses and the rowdy celebrations. The postwoman gently pulls the door shut and carries on downstairs. She thinks the speedy victory over France might actually be good news, because it will have brought the end of the war nearer. And then she&#x2019;ll have her two boys back.<br> The only fly in the ointment is the uncomfortable realization that people like the Persickes will come out on top. To have the likes of them as masters and always have to mind your p&#x2019;s and q&#x2019;s, that doesn&#x2019;t strike her as right either.<br> Briefly she thinks of the man with the bird face who she gave the field post letter to, and she thinks of old Mrs. Rosenthal up on the fourth floor, whose husband the Gestapo took away two weeks ago. You had to feel sorry for someone like that. The Rosenthals used to have a little haberdashery shop on Prenzlauer Allee. That was Aryanized, and now the man&#x2019;s disappeared, and he can&#x2019;t be far short of seventy. Those two old people can&#x2019;t have done any harm to anyone, they always allowed credit &#x2014; they did it for Eva Kluge too when she couldn&#x2019;t afford new clothes for the kids &#x2014; and the goods were certainly no dearer or worse in quality than elsewhere. No, Eva Kluge can&#x2019;t get it into her head that a man like Rosenthal is any worse than the Persickes, just by virtue of him being a Jew. And now the old woman is sitting in her flat all alone, and doesn&#x2019;t dare go outside. It&#x2019;s only after dark that she goes and does her shopping with her yellow star, probably she&#x2019;s hungry. No, thinks Eva Kluge, even if we defeat France ten times over, it doesn&#x2019;t mean there&#x2019;s any justice here at home...<br> And by now she&#x2019;s reached the next house, and she makes her deliveries there.<br> In the meantime shop foreman Otto Quangel has taken the field post letter into the parlor and propped it against the sewing machine. &#x201c;There!&#x201d; he says, nothing more. He always leaves the letters for his wife to open, knowing how devoted she is to their only son Otto. Now he stands facing her, biting his thin under lip, waiting for her smile to light up. In his quiet, undemonstrative way, he loves this woman very much.<br> She has torn open the envelope, for a brief moment there really was a smile lighting up her face, and then it vanished when she saw the typed letter. Her face grew apprehensive, she read more and more slowly, as though afraid of what each next word might be. The man has leaned forward and taken his hands out of his pockets. He is biting his underlip quite hard now, he senses something terrible has happened. It&#x2019;s perfectly silent in their parlor. Only now does the woman&#x2019;s breathing come with a gasp.<br> Suddenly she emits a soft scream, a sound her husband has never heard from her. Her head rolls forward, bangs against the spools of thread on her sewing machine, and comes to rest among the folds of sewing, covering the fateful letter.<br> In a couple of bounds Quangel is at her side. With uncharacteristic haste he places his big, work-toughened hand on her back. He can feel his wife trembling all over. &#x201c;Anna!&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;Anna, please!&#x201d; He waits for a moment, and then he says it: &#x201c;Has something happened to Otto? Is he wounded, is it bad?&#x201d;<br> His wife&#x2019;s body continues to tremble, her mouth doesn&#x2019;t make a sound. She makes no effort to raise her head to look at him.<br> He looks down at her hair, it&#x2019;s gotten thin in the many years of their marriage. They are getting old; if something serious has happened to Otto, she will have no one to love, only him, and there&#x2019;s not much to love about him. He doesn&#x2019;t have words to tell her ever how much he feels for her. Even now he&#x2019;s not able to stroke her, be tender to her, comfort her a little. It&#x2019;s all he can do to rest his heavy hand on her hair, pull her head up as gently as he can, and softly say: &#x201c;Anna, will you tell me what&#x2019;s in the letter?&#x201d;<br> But even though her eyes are now very near to his, she keeps them shut tight, she won&#x2019;t look at him. Her face is a sickly yellow, her usual healthy color is gone. The flesh over her bones seems to have melted away, it&#x2019;s like looking at a skull. Only her cheeks and mouth continue to tremble, as her whole body trembles, caught up in some mysterious inner quake.<br> As Quangel gazes into this so familiar, and now so strange face, as he feels his heart pounding harder and harder, as he feels his complete inability to afford her the least comfort, he is gripped by a deep fear. A ridiculous fear really, compared to the deep pain of his wife, but he is afraid that she might start to scream, scream louder and wilder than she did a moment ago. He was always one for peace and quiet, he didn&#x2019;t want anyone to know anything about the Quangels at home. And as for giving vent to feelings: no, thank you! But even in the grip of his fear, the man isn&#x2019;t able to say any more than he did a moment ago: &#x201c;What is it in the letter? Tell me, Anna!&#x201d;<br> The letter is lying there plain to see, but he doesn&#x2019;t dare to reach for it. He would have to let go his wife&#x2019;s head, and he knows that this head &#x2014; there are two bloody welts on it from the sewing machine &#x2014; would only slump once more. He masters himself, asks again: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened with Ottochen?&#x201d;<br> It&#x2019;s as though the pet name, one that the man hardly ever used, recalled the woman from the world of her pain back into life. She gulps a couple of times, she even opens her eyes, which are very blue, and now look bled white. &#x201c;With Ottochen?&#x201d; she says in a near whisper. &#x201c;What do you think&#x2019;s happened? Nothing has happened, there is no Ottochen any more, that&#x2019;s all!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh!&#x2019; the man says, just a deep &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; from the core of his heart. Without knowing what he&#x2019;s doing, he&#x2019;s let go his wife&#x2019;s head, and has reached for the letter. His eyes stare at the lines, without being able to decipher them.<br> Thereupon the woman grabs the letter from him. Her mood has swung round, furiously she rips the piece of paper into scraps and shreds and fragments, and she shouts into his face: &#x201c;What do you even want to read that filth for, those common lies they always write? That he died a hero&#x2019;s death for Fuhrer and Fatherland? That he was an exemplary soldier and comrade? Do you want to hear that from them, when you know yourself that Ottochen liked nothing better than fiddling about with his radio kits, and that he cried when he was called away to be a soldier? How often he used to say to me when he was recruited that he would give his right hand to be able to get away from them? And now he&#x2019;s supposed to be an exemplary soldier, and died a hero&#x2019;s death? Lies, all a pack of lies! But that&#x2019;s what you get from your wretched war, you and that Fuhrer of yours!&#x201d;<br> Now she&#x2019;s standing in front of him, the woman, so much shorter than he is, but with eyes sparkling with fury.<br> &#x201c;Me and my Fuhrer?&#x201d; he mumbles, stunned by this attack. &#x201c;Since when is he my Fuhrer? I&#x2019;m not even in the Party, just in the Arbeitsfront (*), and everyone has to join that. As for voting for him, I only did that once, and so did you.&#x201d;<br> He says it in his slow and cumbersome manner, not so much to defend himself as to clarify the facts. He still can&#x2019;t understand what induced her to mount this sudden attack on him. They were always of one mind...<br> But she says heatedly: &#x201c;What gives you the right to be the man in the house and determine everything? If I want so much as a space for my potatoes in the cellar, it has to be the way you want it. And in something as important as this, it&#x2019;s you who made the wrong decision. But then you creep around everywhere in carpet slippers, you want your peace and quiet and that&#x2019;s all, and not come to anyone&#x2019;s attention. So you did the same as they all did, and when they yelled: &#x2018;Fuhrer, give us your orders, we will obey!&#x2019; you went with them like a sheep. And the rest of us had to follow you! But now Ottochen&#x2019;s dead, and no Fuhrer in the world can bring him back, and nor can you!&#x201d;<br> He listened to her without saying a word back. He had never been a man for quarrel and argy-bargy, and he could also tell that it was her pain speaking in her. He was almost glad to have her scolding him, because it meant she wasn&#x2019;t giving in to her grief. The only thing he said by way of reply was: &#x201c;One of us will have to tell Trudel.&#x201d;<br> Trudel was Ottochen&#x2019;s girlfriend, almost his fianc�e; she called them Mother and Father. She often dropped in on them for a chat in the evening, even now, with Ottochen away. By day she worked in a uniform factory.<br> The mention of Trudel straightaway set Anna Quangel off on a different track. She glanced at the gleaming clock on the mantel, and asked: &#x201c;Will you have time before your shift?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on from one till eleven today,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got time.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Then go, but just ask her to come. Don&#x2019;t say anything about Ottochen. I&#x2019;ll tell her myself. Your dinner&#x2019;ll be ready by midday.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll go and ask her to come round tonight,&#x201d; he said, but he didn&#x2019;t leave yet, but looked in her jaundiced, ill-looking face. She looked back at him, and for a moment they looked at each other, two people who had been married for almost thirty years, always harmoniously, he quiet and silent, she bringing a bit of life to the place.<br> But however much they now looked at each other, they still had no words to say about this thing that had happened, and so he nodded and went out.<br> She heard the apartment door close. And no sooner was she certain he was gone than she turned back towards the sewing machine, and swept up the scraps of the fateful field post letter. She tried to put them back together, but quickly saw that it would take too long now, and above all she had to get the dinner ready. So she scooped the pieces into the envelope, and slid it inside her hymnbook. In the afternoon, when Otto was at work, she would have time to fit the pieces together and glue them down. It might all be lies, mean, stupid lies, but it remained the last news she would have had of Ottochen. She would keep it safe, and show it to Trudel. Maybe she would be able to cry then; at the moment it still felt like a flame in her heart. It would do her good to be able to cry!<br> She shook her head crossly and went to the stove.</p><h2>Closer Walk New Testament - Hardcover</h2><p>Most orders ship within 24 hours</p><p></p><h2>Death of an Outsider (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 3)</h2><p><i>From the author of the Agatha Raisin television series...</i><b>DEATH OF AN OUTSIDER: A Hamish Macbeth Mystery</b>The most hated man in the most dour town in Scotland is sleeping with the fishes, or-more accurately-dumped into a tank filled with crustaceans. All that remain of the murdered victim are his bones. But after the lobsters are shipped off to Britain's best restaurants, the whole affair quickly lands on the plate of Constable Hamish Macbeth. Exiled with his dog, Towser, to the dreary outpost of Cnothan, Macbeth sorely misses his beloved Lochdubh, his formerly beloved Priscilla Halburton-Smythe, and his days of doing nothing but staring at the sheep grazing in a nearby croft. Now the lawman has to contend with a detective chief inspector who wants the modus operandi hushed up, a dark-haired lass who has an ulterior motive to seduce him, and a killer who has made mincemeat of his victim-and without doubt will strike again . . .</p><p>"Offbeat, utterly endearing. . ."

So begins Fareed Zakaria's important new work on the era we are now entering. Following on the success of his best-selling <em>The Future of Freedom</em>, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the "rise of the rest"&#x2014;the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others&#x2014;as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era? Zakaria answers these questions with his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination.<br><br> <p><strong> Thomas Friedman and Fareed Zakaria: Author One-to-One</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Fareed Zakaria</strong>: Your book is about two things, the climate crisis and also about an American crisis. Why do you link the two?&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Thomas Friedman</strong>: You're absolutely right--it is about two things. The book says, America has a problem and the world has a problem. The world's problem is that it's getting hot, flat and crowded and that convergence--that perfect storm--is driving a lot of negative trends. America's problem is that we've lost our way--we've lost our groove as a country. And the basic argument of the book is that we can solve our problem by taking the lead in solving the world's problem.<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: Explain what you mean by "hot, flat and crowded."<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: There is a convergence of basically three large forces: one is global warming, which has been going on at a very slow pace since the industrial revolution; the second--what I call the flattening of the world--is a metaphor for the rise of middle-class citizens, from China to India to Brazil to Russia to Eastern Europe, who are beginning to consume like Americans. That's a blessing in so many ways--it's a blessing for global stability and for global growth. But it has enormous resource complications, if all these people--whom you've written about in your book, <em>The Post American World</em>--begin to consume like Americans. And lastly, global population growth simply refers to the steady growth of population in general, but at the same time the growth of more and more people able to live this middle-class lifestyle. Between now and 2020, the world's going to add another billion people. And their resource demands--at every level--are going to be enormous. I tell the story in the book how, if we give each one of the next billion people on the planet just one sixty-watt incandescent light bulb, what it will mean: the answer is that it will require about 20 new 500-megawatt coal-burning power plants. That's so they can each turn on just one light bulb!<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: In my book I talk about the "rise of the rest" and about the reality of how this rise of new powerful economic nations is completely changing the way the world works. Most everyone's efforts have been devoted to Kyoto-like solutions, with the idea of getting western countries to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. But I grew to realize that the West was a sideshow. India and China will build hundreds of coal-fire power plants in the next ten years and the combined carbon dioxide emissions of those new plants alone are five times larger than the savings mandated by the Kyoto accords. What do you do with the Indias and Chinas of the world?<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: I think there are two approaches. There has to be more understanding of the basic unfairness they feel. They feel like we sat down, had the hors d'oeuvres, ate the entr�e, pretty much finished off the dessert, invited them for tea and coffee and then said, "Let's split the bill." So I understand the big sense of unfairness--they feel that now that they have a chance to grow and reach with large numbers a whole new standard of living, we're basically telling them, "Your growth, and all the emissions it would add, is threatening the world's climate." At the same time, what I say to them--what I said to young Chinese most recently when I was just in China is this: Every time I come to China, young Chinese say to me, "Mr. Friedman, your country grew dirty for 150 years. Now it's our turn." And I say to them, "Yes, you're absolutely right, it's your turn. Grow as dirty as you want. Take your time. Because I think we probably just need about five years to invent all the new clean power technologies you're going to need as you choke to death, and we're going to come and sell them to you. And we're going to clean your clock in the next great global industry. So please, take your time. If you want to give us a five-year lead in the next great global industry, I will take five. If you want to give us ten, that would be even better. In other words, I know this is unfair, but I am here to tell you that in a world that's hot, flat and crowded, ET--energy technology--is going to be as big an industry as IT--information technology. Maybe even bigger. And who claims that industry--whose country and whose companies dominate that industry--I think is going to enjoy more national security, more economic security, more economic growth, a healthier population, and greater global respect, for that matter, as well. So you can sit back and say, it's not fair that we have to compete in this new industry, that we should get to grow dirty for a while, or you can do what you did in telecommunications, and that is try to leap-frog us. And that's really what I'm saying to them: this is a great economic opportunity. The game is still open. I want my country to win it--I'm not sure it will.<br><br><strong>Zakaria</strong>: I'm struck by the point you make about energy technology. In my book I'm pretty optimistic about the United States. But the one area where I'm worried is actually ET. We do fantastically in biotech, we're doing fantastically in nanotechnology. But none of these new technologies have the kind of system-wide effect that information technology did. Energy does. If you want to find the next technological revolution you need to find an industry that transforms everything you do. Biotechnology affects one critical aspect of your day-to-day life, health, but not all of it. But energy--the consumption of energy--affects every human activity in the modern world. Now, my fear is that, of all the industries in the future, that's the one where we're not ahead of the pack. Are we going to run second in this race?<br><br><strong>Friedman</strong>: Well, I want to ask you that, Fareed. Why do you think we haven't led this industry, which itself has huge technological implications? We have all the secret sauce, all the technological prowess, to lead this industry. Why do you think this is the one area--and it's enormous, it's actually going to dwarf all the others--where we haven't been at the real cutting edge?<br><br></p> <strong>Continue reading the Q&amp;A between Thomas Friedman and Fareed Zakaria</strong> <br> <br><strong>An essential update of the bestselling global phenomenon</strong><br><br> A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of the Year<br><br> In this new edition of his international blockbuster, Fareed Zakaria continues to explore the shifting role of the United States in the rapidly changing landscape of world affairs.

Drawing on the largest extant bi-racial correspondence in the Civil War era, John Stauffer braids together these men's struggles to reconcile ideals of justice with the reality of slavery and oppression. Who could imagine that Gerrit Smith, one of the richest men in the country, would give away his wealth to the poor and ally himself with Frederick Douglass, an ex-slave? And why would James McCune Smith, the most educated black man in the country, link arms with John Brown, a bankrupt entrepreneur, along with the others? Distinguished by their interracial bonds, they shared a millennialist vision of a new world where everyone was free and equal. </p><p> As the nation headed toward armed conflict, these men waged their own war by establishing model interracial communities, forming a new political party, and embracing violence. Their revolutionary ethos bridged the divide between the sacred and the profane, black and white, masculine and feminine, and civilization and savagery that had long girded western culture. In so doing, it embraced a malleable and "black-hearted" self that was capable of violent revolt against a slaveholding nation, in order to usher in a kingdom of God on earth. In tracing the rise and fall of their prophetic vision and alliance, Stauffer reveals how radical reform helped propel the nation toward war even as it strove to vanquish slavery and preserve the peace. </p></p><p><b>John Stauffer</b> is Professor of English and American Literature and Language and Professor of African and African American Studies at Harvard University.More than an engaging history of antislavery, this volume, with its abundant use of primary sources, restores James McCune Smith and Gerrit Smith to their historical positions as preeminent radical abolitionists and pioneer fighters against racism. Highly recommended for academic and public libraries. (Charles L.

(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2001-11-15)<br><br>Stauffer offers an account of these four lives joined for a historical moment by 'their vision of a sacred, sin-free, and pluralist society, as well as by their willingness to use violence to effect it.' Stauffer shows how the four worked together on temperance and feminist issues, party building, and other political work along with their antislavery activities, exploring the practical and ideological glue that held them together. A splendidly illustrated excursion into the American fascination with daguerreotype shows the four using that form to further their public image...[<i>Black Hearts of Men</i>] offers an intense look at the mechanics of freedom.

(Barry Gewen <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2002-03-24)<br><br>Stauffer intertwines the antislavery activities of Frederick Douglas, James McCune Smith, John Brown, and Gerrit Smith. These four men...were deeply religious reformers who first sought to utilize peaceful means to end slavery and promote racial integration in antebellum America. Failing to achieve these objectives, they adopted a militant position by organizing the Radical Abolition Party endorsing violence, justifying their actions in the name of righteousness...The book expands our knowledge of the changing nature of antislavery and antebellum reform as the nation approached the Civil War. (L. B. Gimelli <i>Choice</i> 2002-10-01)<br><br><i>The Black Hearts of Men</i> is a richly interdisciplinary study, examining portraiture, literature, religion, intellectual biography, and the wider social and cultural context provided by antebellum America...Many avenues for further scholarship are suggested by this discussion...Stauffer does capture the potential for revolutionary change in the antebellum United States embodied in the radical abolitionists, and culminating in the state violence of the civil war. The work provides useful intellectual/political biographies of the key actors for the period of study, suggesting that their methods, motivations, and self-image were far from simple.

In gentle scenes that reflect the colors of the setting sun or are lightened by the stars and moon under a dusky-blue sky, anthropomorphized trains prepare to bed down for the night. "Where do snowplow trains sleep / after all the tracks are clear? / Do their moms say, &#x2018;Plow your toys, kids&#x2014; / bedtime's almost here'?" The rhyming verse and illustration pair to make clear to readers the job of each train: the monorail's heavy-lidded eyes look toward the airport it services, and the subway rests under a brightly lit and busy city street reminiscent of Times Square. Trains include steam, passenger, freight, fire, high-speed, and breakdown trains as well as trolleys, and the ending suitably places most around a roundhouse under their blanket of stars...before a turn of the page reveals a boy and a girl asleep in their twin beds, their toy trains and tracks laid out in an otherwise pristine bedroom. Pair this with Kevin Lewis' Chugga-chugga Choo-choo, illustrated by Daniel Kirk (1999), for more train fun.

In The Potty Book, Hannah needs to have her diapers changed so she can go out and play. Then mom and dad bring home a big box, and Hannah is anxious to open it up and see what&#39;s inside. Is it a rocking chair? A bed for Teddy? No, it&#39;s a potty--which means that it&#39;s time for Hannah to graduate from her diapers. This gentle and humorous little story is charmingly illustrated and told in verse. Little girls will enjoy looking at the pictures and having the story read to them.

These two are almost exact duplicates, both in text and illustration. The only differences are the names, Henry/Hannah; the addition or subtraction of a ponytail on the child's head; and the colors used-blue or pink, of course. A cutesy, rhymed text in the child's voice tells toddlers how Henry/Hannah receives his/her very own potty "to use when I am ready." Then the narrator goes on to relate how he/she sits on it, has success, and is rewarded with new underwear, not to mention the praise and applause of Mommy and Daddy. This is virtually the same plot as any other potty-training book aimed at this audience and their parents. Some have a tad more humor and imagination, like Wendy Lewison's The Princess &amp; the Potty (S &amp; S, 1994). Others are a bit more straightforward, such as Alona Frankel's Once Upon a Potty (Barron's, 1980). These two add nothing new or noteworthy or imaginative.

When you were writing the first story starring Percy Jackson, did you ever imagine it would become such a phenomenon? How has the success of the series affected your life?</p> <p><b>Rick Riordan:</b> I had no expectations other than to make a good story for my older son, Haley. I had no idea it would become a book, much less a series, until he encouraged me to write down the story.</p> <p>I hoped the stories would get kids reading, but I never anticipated such exponential growth. It was not an overnight success, nor was it heavily marketed at the beginning. <i>The Lightning Thief</i> was passed around from kid to kid, teacher to teacher, parent to parent, and the series got bigger with each book. It really was a grassroots phenomenon. Still, I have trouble thinking in terms of millions. I measure success by anecdotes--the kid who told me he never liked books until he found <i>The Lightning Thief</i>, the parent who thanked me for turning her daughter into a reader, the teacher who said I turned her class around because they bonded over reading Percy Jackson every day. That's what it's all about for me.</p> <p>It hasn't changed our life much other than making me busier, but doing something I love! I still drive the same car. My kids go to the same schools. We try our best to keep things simple at home.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You've said that you wrote this series for your son, Haley, who, like the book's hero Percy, has been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. How does Haley feel about being the inspiration for a bestselling series?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> Both my sons are always my first audience. I read the manuscripts to them aloud to make sure they work for young readers. Both are proud, though being teenagers they are also embarrassed by the attention they get sometimes. They don't like it when classmates ask them to get my autograph. Haley likes to play down his importance in the genesis of the series, but I think he's enjoyed growing up with Percy, and I know it has increased his interest in writing. Recently he came into my office and announced the manuscript he is working on now has a bigger word count than mine! </p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy's stories are based on Greek mythology--classic tales that have been passed down for thousands of years. What lessons can kids today learn from the ancient myths?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> The stories have everything--romance, magic, mystery, action, and great characters. The Greek gods are our first superheroes. They have amazing powers, but they are also very human and subject to jealousy, envy, anger, etc. Kids especially respond to them because they are both powerful and accessible. Who wouldn't want to be the son or daughter of a Greek god? By reading about the struggles of gods and heroes, we learn a lot about being human, and that's something that hasn't changed over the millennia.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Have you ever visited Greece? What was it like?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I&#x2019;ve been to both Italy and Greece, but only after I finished the Percy Jackson series, which is ironic. One doesn't need to travel there, however, to appreciate the stories from mythology. Those are quite universal. Greece actually reminded me quite a bit of my home in Texas--hot, green, hilly, somewhat arid, except the ocean is much better in Greece.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy&#x2019;s guardian satyr, Grover, is strongly connected to the Earth, the well-being of animals, and humans' emotions. Moreover, Percy's life is relatively free of technology, in contrast to many people today. Is there a message about the natural world that you're hoping to convey through Percy and Grover?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I don't consciously put messages in the books, because my job is telling a good story, not preaching. However, I do pick up on themes from Greek mythology that still resonate in the modern world, and certainly man's relationship to nature is one of those. I&#x2019;ve always been fascinated by the god Pan, and his reported death in ancient times. It seemed a very relevant theme for modern readers.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Percy encounters many dangers throughout his adventures--some that could be considered beyond the abilities of a normal 12-year-old. Though we know Percy is no normal kid, where does he find the find the strength to overcome all the challenges that he encounters?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> None of us knows what we're capable of until we are called to action. Percy may have demigod abilities, but he's a very normal kid in a lot of ways. He goes from a 12-year-old who is unsure of himself and his relationship with his friends and family, to a 16-year-old young man who steps up and leads a war to save Olympus. Most heroes are born out of dire circumstances, and Percy is no exception. He's afraid, unsure, doubtful, angry--all the things we would be if we were called to deal with a crisis. But he does the job anyway, and that is the definition of courage.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> It's often said that writers write about what they know. Were you interested in the ancient world when you were Percy's age? What kinds of books were your favorites when you were a kid?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I've always loved mythology. I had a great English teacher who showed me that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> (the only series I would read at age thirteen) was based on Norse myths, and from then on, I was a mythology buff. I taught mythology in my own classroom when I became a teacher, and it was consistently my students' favorite unit.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> If you discovered, like Percy, that you were the son of a Greek god, who would you want your immortal parent to be?</p> <p><b>Riordan:</b> I'd like Poseidon or Athena, but with my luck, I'd end up with Dionysus.</p> <br> <br> <br><strong>Rick Riordan </strong>(www.rickriordan.com)<strong> </strong>is the author of all five books in the #1 <em>New York Times</em><strong><i> </i></strong>best-selling Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, as well as <em>The Kane Chronicles, Book One:</em> <em>The Red Pyramid</em>.

Simple, yet profoundly satisfying." &#x2013; <i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b><br><br>At Mommy&#x2019;s house, Alex has a soft chair. At Daddy&#x2019;s house, Alex has a rocking chair. In each home, Alex also has a special bedroom and lots of friends to play with. But whether Alex is with Mommy or with Daddy, one thing always stays the same - Alex is loved. The gently reassuring text focuses on what is gained rather than what is lost when parents divorce, while the sensitive illustrations, depicting two unique homes in all their small details, firmly establish Alex&#x2019;s place in both of them. <i>Two Homes</i> will help children - and parents - embrace even the most difficult of changes with an open and optimistic heart.</p><p>Claire Masurel is the author of numerous books for children, including TOO BIG, illustrated by Hanako Wakiyama. TWO HOMES is her first book for Candlewick Press. She wrote the story after talking to a child who was sad about her parents&#x2019; recent divorce. She says, "To comfort her, I talked about her two homes, and all the many things <br>she could do in them. It was a positive way of helping her accept the changes in her life, focusing not on what was missed, but on the abundance of good times &#x2014; and love &#x2014; that she would continue to share with her mom and dad."<br>Kady MacDonald Denton is the illustrator of A CHILD'S TREASURY OF NURSERY RHYMES and two books by Margaret Park Bridges - IF I WERE YOUR FATHER and IF I WERE YOUR MOTHER. TWO HOMES is her first book for Candlewick Press. She says, "Alex talks about simple things like toothbrushes, bedrooms, and friends &#x2014; and they are all special because they are part of the love Alex feels in both homes. I tried to show that love in the illustrations."*Starred Review* Ages 2-5. Young Alex introduces himself and his parents, then announces that he has two homes: sometimes he lives with Daddy (in a suburban house) and sometimes with Mommy (in a city apartment). The discussion of his two homes sets up the book's comfortable dual structure: "I have <i>two</i> rooms. My room at Daddy's. My room at Mommy's . . . I have <i>two</i> bathrooms. I have a toothbrush at Daddy's. I have a toothbrush at Mommy's." Each spread includes complementary pictures that show the boy engaged in similar activities at both locales. The ending affirms that his parents love Alex, no matter where he is and no matter where they are. Within the ink, watercolor, and gouache illustrations are delightful reproductions of Alex's own paintings. Other scenes, warm with luminous washes against white backgrounds, celebrate the everyday details of Alex's life. Parents looking for a book about separation or divorce will find few offerings as positive, matter-of-fact, or child-centered as this one. With a sure sense of audience, Masurel concentrates on the physical and emotional fundamentals that matter to children while deftly sidestepping the adult-oriented swamp of explanation and supposition. Enhanced by Denton's sensitively drawn portrayals of the characters within well-imagined scenes of domestic life, this picture book will validate the experience of other two-household children while intriguing those in single-home families. Simple, yet profoundly satisfying. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Since then, bucket filling has spread around the world to help millions of people of all ages have happier and more rewarding lives. In this revised and updated edition, the verbs "bucket dipping" and "bullying" have replaced the nouns "bucket dipper" and "bully" to help readers understand that "bucket dipping" and "bullying" are negative behaviors (what we are doing) and not permanent labels (who we are). Readers will also learn that you can fill or dip into your own bucket.<br><br>I first learned about bucket filling in a seminar for early childhood educators in the 1990s. The speaker, a brain research expert,said it is helpful to think of every person as being born with an invisible bucket. The bucket represents a person's mental and emotional health. You can't see the bucket, but it's there. She said that it is primarily the responsibility of parents and other caregivers to fill a child's bucket. When you hold, caress, nurture, touch, sing, play, and provide loving attention,safety, and care, you fill a child's bucket. Giving that love is filling buckets.<br><br>In addition to being loved, children must also be taught how to love others. Children who learn how to express kindness and love lead happier lives. When you care about others and show that love by what you say and do, you feel good and you fill your own bucket, too.<br><br>As you read this book with children, use it as an opportunity to model this concept by filling their buckets. Tell them why they are special to you. Help them imagine whose bucket they might fill and what they could say or do to fill a bucket. Tell them whose bucket you filled that day. Practice with them to become daily bucket fillers. Very quickly they will experience the pride and joy of filling buckets.<br><br>Learn more about bucket filling through our website, bucketfillers101.com,<b> </b><b></b><b></b>and be sure to sign up for our free e-newsletter, BUCKET FILLOSOPHY� 101.

Gail Herman traces the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, whose rabid anti-Semitism led first to humiliating anti-Jewish laws, then to ghettos all over Eastern Europe, and ultimately to the Final Solution. She presents just enough information for an elementary-school audience in a readable, well-researched book that covers one of the most horrible times in history.<br><br>This entry in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series contains eighty carefully chosen illustrations and sixteen pages of black and white photographs suitable for young readers.</p><p>Gail Herman has written several young biographies for children, including <i>Who Was Jackie Robinson?</i><b>What Was the Holocaust?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b><br>May 1945: Volary, a small town in what is now the Czech Republic</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Gerda Weissmann stood outside an old bicycle factory. She weighed sixty-five pounds. Her hair was white, although she was not even twenty-one.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the empty building, dozens of women lay on straw. Most were sick. Many were dying. Like Gerda, they were all Jewish. For many years they had suffered under the rule of Nazi Germany.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Gerda, the horror had begun six years earlier.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was late summer. She was fifteen years old. And she had just come home from vacation. On September 1, 1939, the weather was glorious, the sky a bright blue. Suddenly, German airplanes blocked the sun. They roared over Gerda&#x2019;s home in Bielsko, Poland. Tanks rolled down the streets. The German army was invading Poland.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the start of World War II, which lasted in Europe until May of 1945.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many local people waved Nazi flags. They cheered for their new leader, Adolf Hitler. They were glad Hitler had taken over Poland. Hitler hoped to take over all of Europe.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jews of Bielsko were not happy at all. They knew of the Nazis&#x2019; hatred for Jews.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gerda and her family were told to leave their home so local German-Poles could move in. Gerda&#x2019;s garden was fenced off with a sign that read: &#x201c;No dogs or Jews allowed.&#x201d; They lived in a basement, with no water or electricity.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a while, all Jews in Bielsko were rounded up. Trucks took them to different prison camps. Gerda was separated from her mother. She never saw her again. She never saw anybody else in her family again, either. Through the rest of the war, Gerda was moved from one concentration camp to another. She labored in Nazi-run factories. She hauled coal onto trains. By 1945, she was half-dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet Gerda was one of the more fortunate ones. She survived.<br> &nbsp;<br> Six million Jews did not. They were killed by the Nazis in concentration camps. About six million other victims were also led to their deaths: gay people, the Roma, disabled people, and people from certain religious and political groups.<br> &nbsp;<br> That day in 1945 at the factory, Gerda saw a car approach. Two men&#x2014;United States soldiers&#x2014;jumped out. One came over. He was big and strong. To Gerda, he looked like a god.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Does anybody here speak German or English?&#x201d; he asked in German.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I speak German,&#x201d; Gerda answered. Then she added, &#x201c;We are Jewish, you know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; the man said. His name was Kurt Klein. &#x201c;May I see the other ladies?&#x201d; he added. Then the man held the door for Gerda to go inside the factory. It was a simple, polite thing to do. But it made her feel human again.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year later, Gerda and Kurt Klein were married.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gerda Weissmann&#x2019;s wartime story ended on a note of hope. That was rare for the millions who suffered during the Holocaust.<br> &nbsp;<br> The word <i>holocaust</i>&#x2014;rooted in Greek&#x2014;means a &#x201c;sacrifice by fire.&#x201d; But it also means any great destruction and loss of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> From 1939 to 1945, all across Europe, Jews and people from other groups were murdered simply because of who they were.<br> &nbsp;<br> How did this happen?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Anti-Semitism</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Anti-Semitism is the hatred of Jews. It goes back thousands of years to ancient Rome.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Christianity took hold in the world, anti-Jewish feeling spread. There were false, awful stories that Jews had killed Jesus. They were blamed for causing disease and for bad crops. Sometimes this led to violent attacks against Jews. Sometimes anti-Jewish laws were passed: In certain parts of Europe, Jews couldn&#x2019;t own land. They could not be citizens.<br> &nbsp;<br> In more modern times, around the 1800s, countries in Europe developed fairer laws. Life opened up for Jewish people. They had more freedom. Some Jews kept their old customs. Some did not. More and more, Jews considered themselves German&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or Austrian&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or French&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before they thought of themselves as Jewish.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, in 1914, the kaiser (emperor) of Germany started a world war in Europe. It raged on until 1918 with Germany&#x2019;s surrender. A treaty was signed with very harsh terms for Germany. The kaiser was gone. Germany lost land. It had to disband its army. For starting the war, it had to pay billions of dollars to the countries that Germany had fought against. But Germany didn&#x2019;t have any money.<br> &nbsp;<br> As in the past, much of the blame for Germany&#x2019;s woes fell on the Jews. In 1919, Germany tried to set up a democracy. The group of elected representatives was called the Reichstag. A president was elected, too. The president, in turn, chose a chancellor. The chancellor held a lot of power. But he still had to answer to the president and the Reichstag.<br> &nbsp;<br> This new government was supposed to offer a better future for Germany. But it faced big challenges. For example, how would Germany pay all the money it owed? The government thought the answer was to print money. More and more money.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon there were so many German dollars&#x2014;marks&#x2014;they became almost worthless. Prices went up day by day, hour by hour. One man bought a cup of coffee for 5,000 marks, already a very high price. When he ordered a second cup, the price had shot up to 9,000 marks! People carried cash around in wheelbarrows.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> By 1929, millions of Germans were out of work. Most had their savings wiped out. Many wanted change, a new direction for the country.<br> &nbsp;<br> But who could lead the country to a new and better future?<br> &nbsp;<br> Germans turned to the worst person possible&#x2014;Adolf Hitler.</p><h2>God&#39;s Medicine</h2><p>What are those provisions?

This means your choice of career is one of the most important decisions you&#x2019;ll ever make. <br><br> Make the right choices, and you can help solve some of the world&#x2019;s most pressing problems, as well as have a more rewarding, interesting life. <br><br> For such an important decision, however, there&#x2019;s surprisingly little good advice out there. Most career advice focuses on things like how to write a CV, and much of the rest is just (misleading) platitudes like &#x201c;follow your passion&#x201d;. Most people we speak to don&#x2019;t even use career advice &#x2013; they just speak to friends and try to figure it out for themselves. <br><br> When it comes to helping others with your career the advice usually assumes you need to work as a teacher, doctor, charity worker, and so on, even though these paths might not be a good fit for you, and were not what the highest-impact people in history did. <br><br> This guide is based on five years of research conducted alongside academics at the University of Oxford. It aims to help you find a career you enjoy, you&#x2019;re good at, and that tackles the world&#x2019;s most pressing problems. <br><br> It covers topics like: <br> 1. What makes for a dream job, and why &#x201c;follow your passion&#x201d; can be misleading. 2. Why the most effective ways to make a difference aren&#x2019;t always the obvious ones like working at a charity, or becoming a doctor. 3. How to compare global problems, like climate change and education, in terms of their scale and urgency. 4. How to discover and develop your strengths. <br> It&#x2019;s also full of practical tips and tools. You&#x2019;ll come away with a plan to use your 80,000 hours in a way that&#x2019;s fulfilling and high impact. <br><br> <b>What people are saying</b> <br><br> <i>&#x201c;Based on evidence and good sense, not platitudes&#x201d; </i><br> - Steven Pinker, New York Times bestselling author Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. <br><br> <i>&#x201c;This incredible group is helping people have a greater social impact with their careers.&#x201d; </i><br> - Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. <br><br> <i>&#x201c;Every college grad should read this&#x201d; </i><br> - Tim Urban, creator of Wait But Why. <br><br> <b>Read more online</b> <br> This book is based on the free guide you can find on the 80,000 Hours website, where you can find many more articles and our most up-to-date content.

Although Jake has a range of fine guitars in his house his favourite music software is Sibelius and, having worked with Cubase for many years, is now moving over to Logic Pro.5.0 out of 5 stars | Excellent tool for beginners! | By Scottish-Mermaidon | I am very pleased with this purchase. I am a beginner at guitar and have found this book very good for getting me to grips with the chords. The book shows all chords from more than one position, which is great as there are a few ways to play each chord. The chord diagrams are very clear thus easy to understand. So much so, I also recommend this for the young beginner. It&#39;s good if you want to teach yourself or if you wish to use it to compliment professional lessons. Personally, I am teaching myself and have found that using this alongside the fantastic Garage band guitar tutorials is a great combination and I am learning very quickly too. It is quite a thick booklet but not a large book so won&#39;t take up too much room in a bag. As other reviewers have also mentioned...it is ring binded meaning it is easy to leave open to glance at whilst your hands are occupied with the guitar. I recommend this to anyone who plays or wants to play guitar. Amazon 5.0 out of 5 stars | Best chord book | By A. Thomason | Simple as that easy to read and navigate, even for those who get numbers and letters mixed up one chord picture per page with a few more advanced ones added in the back, spiral-bound (who would want a paperback that closes itself all the time?) if you need a chord book, this is the one. Amazon 5.0 out of 5 stars | Great book! | ByBigBoolson | Really clear to understand chord book, the fact its spiral bound is awesome and makes it easier to leave open on the page you&#39;re viewing. For the people who say its not clear to understand and doesn&#39;t teach anything, its not a tuition book!! Its simply a chord dictionary!! I&#39;ve had a few chord books, this is by far the best one.

The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2014;clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.</p><p>Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion&#x2014;a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci&#x2014;and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle&#x2014;while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move&#x2014;the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</p></p><p>With <i>The Da Vinci Code,</i> Dan Brown masterfully concocts an intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating esoteria culled from 2,000 years of Western history. <p> A murder in the silent after-hour halls of the Louvre museum reveals a sinister plot to uncover a secret that has been protected by a clandestine society since the days of Christ. The victim is a high-ranking agent of this ancient society who, in the moments before his death, manages to leave gruesome clues at the scene that only his granddaughter, noted cryptographer Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a famed symbologist, can untangle. The duo become both suspects and detectives searching for not only Neveu's grandfather's murderer but also the stunning secret of the ages he was charged to protect. Mere steps ahead of the authorities and the deadly competition, the mystery leads Neveu and Langdon on a breathless flight through France, England, and history itself. Brown (<i>Angels and Demons</i>) has created a page-turning thriller that also provides an amazing interpretation of Western history. Brown's hero and heroine embark on a lofty and intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail. Though some will quibble with the veracity of Brown's conjectures, therein lies the fun. <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>"Dan Brown has to be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the country.

Glennon lives in Florida with her family.<p>"A testament to the power of vulnerability. Glennon shows us the clearest meaning of 'To thine ownself be true.' It's as if she reached into her heart, captured the raw emotions there, and translated them into words that anyone who's ever known pain or shame &#x2015; in other words, every human on the planet &#x2015; can relate to. She's bravely put everything on the table for the whole world to see."<br><b><i>&#x2015; </i>Oprah Winfrey<i> (Oprah's Book Club 2016 selection)</i></b></p><p>"Glennon is not merely relaying a narrative; she is offering her story with the hope and purpose of connection. <i>Love Warrior...</i> draws you in close, as if the author is talking to you, and only to you. Listening to such a warm and emotionally intelligent author is a worthy investment in a course on difficult conversations. But I suspect that... what will win you over is all the 'terrible magic' that happens when things fall apart."<br><b><i>&#x2015; New York Times Book Review </i></b><br><b></b><br><b></b>"An incredible, dark, poignant, vulnerable personal account about surviving rock bottom and finding a better life. You will be inspired by [Glennon's] resilience, strength, and womanhood."<br><i><b>&#x2015; Real Simple</b></i></p><p>"This memoir isn&#x2019;t really about Glennon rebuilding her relationship with her husband; it's about Glennon rebuilding her relationship with herself. It&#x2019;s about one woman letting go of the gendered messages she&#x2019;s been surrounded by her entire life, and communing with her fullest, most authentic self. Utterly refreshing and... just totally badass."<br><b>&#x2015; Bustle.com</b></p><p>"<i>Love Warrior</i> reaches a depth of truth and power and emotional gravity that is rarely seen in the world, and even more rarely spoken aloud. Glennon's story about the resurrection of her marriage (a tale of a woman daring to come into her body, and a man daring to come into his mind, and the two of them daring &#x2015; with outrageous courage &#x2015; to trust each other) is something beyond merely inspirational; it is epic. I think of this book as the vital, long-overdue, much-needed sister memoir to <i>Eat Pray Love</i>. Glennon lifts the roof off her whole house &#x2015; her whole life &#x2015; and examines everything, right out in the open. She has, indeed, become a <i>Love Warrior.</i> This book is an act of love and truth and generosity; it will change lives."<br><b>&#x2015; Elizabeth Gilbert, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Big Magic</i> and <i>Eat Pray Love</i></b></p><p>"This is a book about what it means to be human &#x2015; to wrestle with love, hurt, addiction, vulnerability, intimacy, and grace. <i>Love Warrior</i> blew me away. We can all find pieces of our own stories reflected in Glennon's powerful words. We are so lucky to have her courage and wisdom in the world. We need this kind of truth telling if we are ever going to find our way back to each other."<br><b>&#x2015; Bren� Brown, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Rising Strong</i> and <i>Daring Greatly</i></b></p><p>"How can I do justice to this book? Moving and brilliant and funny and shocking and heartbreaking and inspiring, <i>Love Warrior </i>raises provocative questions about just what is possible for a person, a marriage, a family, a life. At the heart of this story is the insistence that we don't have to settle &#x2015; we can explore our shadows, and we're not just going to survive it, but we're going to come out the other side a whole new person with new love, new hope, new strength, and maybe even a new marriage. This is a big, stunning, buoyant, honest, raw glimpse into the life of an astonishing woman, but it is also a punch in the face to anyone anywhere who believes that this is just how it is and it's not going to get any better."<br><b>&#x2015; Rob Bell, <i>NewYork Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Love Wins</i></b></p><p>"This elegant, moving memoir is about one woman's marriage but also much more than that. Glennon writes about a hunger for love that all of us feel and the only food that ultimately feeds us. She understands the unique relationship between spiritual and romantic love, and in finding one, she masters the other. Truly a wonderful book."<br><b>&#x2015; Marianne Williamson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Return to Love</i></b></p><p>"When I finished the last page of <i>Love Warrior</i>, I sobbed. I sobbed because I was in awe. Because I didn't want it to end. Because it made me believe more deeply in love, in humanity, in forgiveness, in God, in marriage. Glennon and Craig have invited us so far into the messy, beautiful, difficult insides of their hearts and lives, and what we find there is profoundly inspiring. This is a book that will change lives, change marriages, change the way we think and talk about what love really is."<br><b>&#x2015; Shauna Niequist, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Present Over Perfect</i></b></p><p>"Glennon Doyle has mastered sharing her emotional life with the world, which she does nearly daily on momastery.com.

Snow had fallen and the streets glittered. Maria's favorite cousins were coming over and she got to help make the tamales for Christmas dinner. It was almost too good to be true when her mother left the kitchen for a moment and Maria got to try on her beautiful diamond ring . . .<br><br>This is the story of a treasure thought to be lost in a batch of tamales; of a desperate adn funny attempt by Maria and her cousins to eat their way out of trouble; and the warm way a family pulls together to make it a perfect Christmas after all.<br><br>Also available in Spanish as �Q<i>u�&nbsp;mont�n de tamales!</i></p><p>Maria is feeling so grown-up, wearing her mother's apron and helping to knead the <i>masa</i> for the Christmas corn tamales. Her mother even let Maria wear some perfume and lipstick for the big family celebration that evening. When her mother takes off her diamond ring so it won't become coated with the messy masa, Maria decides that life would be perfect if she could wear the ring, too. Trouble begins when she sneakily slips the sparkly ring on her thumb and resumes her kneading. Uh oh. It is not until later that night, after all the tamales have been cooked and after all her cousins and relatives have arrived, that Maria suddenly realizes what must have happened to the precious ring. Ed Martinez's warm oil paintings celebrate the riches of South American Christmas colors--adobe reds, dusty gold, lacey whites, and rain-forest greens. Martinez also has a gift for capturing children's animated expressions, especially when Maria begs her cousins to help her find the missing ring by secretly eating the enormous stack of steaming tamales! Gary Soto's delightful Christmas-spirit closure will relieve young readers who empathize with the negligent Maria. Grown-ups, too, will appreciate this playful reminder about the virtues of forgiveness and family togetherness.

In 2005, while attending Rider University, he became an intern at&nbsp;<i>Salt Water Sportsman</i>&nbsp;magazine, joining the editorial staff full time that same year after graduation. In 2008, he moved to sister publication&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream</i>, where he was named Fishing Editor in 2011.

Cermele has fished all over the country and abroad, but when he&#x2019;s not traveling on assignment, you can find him on his boat chasing tuna and striped bass off the Jersey coast, pitching tubes to smallmouth bass on the Delaware River, or flyfishing for trout in New York&#x2019;s Catskill Mountains.<b>153 ENJOY THE SUMMERTIME BLUES</b><br> Don&#x2019;t give up on slab bluegills once summer heat drives them from the shallows. Here are three killer tactics to catch big bulls in deep water.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>MATCH A MAYFLY HATCH </b><br> With the exception of the spawn, mayfly hatches mean the best opportunities to catch big bluegills. Cruise the lake and check any place where wind corrals the bugs into confined areas near deep water<br> (A). &#x201c;Target the banks that are closest to the channel, where the wind blows the larvae into the bank,&#x201d; says Ron Lappin, a retired Kentucky guide and panfish pro. &#x201c;The higher the bank, the better the hatch is. Look for places where the wind can blow across a large area.&#x201d; Cast to the bank and use a slow retrieve, occasionally pausing to let a spinner or jig glide on a semi-slack line just above bottom.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>PITCH AROUND PILINGS </b><br> Bridge pilings across deep areas and large tributaries offer vertical current breaks where bluegills can rise from cooler water to feed near the surface (B). In these spots, Lappin fishes a drop-shot rig: He suspends a Brim Reaper bug on a No. 6 long-shank cricket hook 12 to 18 inches above a 1/16 - to 1/8 &#x2013;ounce cylinder weight. Lappin fishes it on a 9-foot float-and-fly rod and suggests keeping the line length no longer than the rod. &#x201c;A lot of pilings have steel cross members between them,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ll get the biggest concentrations of bluegills.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>CAST IN CURRENTS </b><br> Most reservoirs have manmade current sources, such as a dam, its turbines, culverts, and locks (C). These attract bluegills and are best if they are in deeper spots or have a large concrete structure like a dock piling nearby. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see bluegills almost swarming in these areas after the spawn,&#x201d; says Lappin. He floats a live cricket, rigged on a No. 6 cricket hook, under an acorn-size bobber (Pinch two split shot onto the line between the cricket and bobber), starting on the sunny side of the structure, then shifts to the shaded side, casting directly against the dam.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Elmo&#39;s Little Dreidel (Sesame Street)</h2><p><p>What's a dreidel?

One by one, doughnuts were chosen, placed in paper bags, and whisked away with their new owners. Some went by the dozen in giant boxes.</i><br><i>"Good-bye!" Arnie yelled to each doughnut. "Have a good trip!"</i><br><i>"This is so exciting!" Arnie beamed. "I wonder who will choose ME?"</i></p><p>At first glance, Arnie looks like an average doughnut&#x2015;round, cakey, with a hole in the middle, iced and sprinkled. He was made by one of the best bakeries in town, and admittedly his sprinkles are candy-colored. Still, a doughnut is just a doughnut, right?</p><p>WRONG! Not if Arnie has anything to say about it. And, for a doughnut, he sure seems to have an awful lot to say. Can Arnie change the fate of all doughnuts&#x2015;or at least have a hand in his own future? Well, you'll just have to read this funny story and find out for yourself. This title has Common Core connections</p><p><i>Arnie, the Doughnut</i> is a 2004 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p>Laurie Keller, creator of the wonderful picture books <i>The Scrambled States of America</i> and <i>Open Wide: Tooth School Inside</i>, cooks up a rather silly story about a doughnut who narrowly escapes his doughnut fate. Arnie is proud to be chocolate-covered, with bright-colored candy sprinkles. His first day on the planet is a big one. He is 1) cut into a ring 2) deep-fried 3) cooled 4) iced 5) sprinkled and 6) named Arnie. What he doesn't realize is that step 7 is being eaten by a human. So, when a customer, Mr. Bing, starts to put him in his mouth, he screams, "What are you doing?" Arnie is further crushed when he calls the bakery to warn the others only to discover that all the other pastries are "aware of this arrangement." Unfortunately, this delightful plot twist is soured by the contrived ones that follow. Mr. Bing decides that in order to get his money's worth from Arnie he can pretend the doughnut is the dog he's always wanted--a doughnut-dog that will roll over, play fetch, etc.: "He went through a short phase of chewing on the furniture and barking at the mailman, but after a crash course in obedience school he graduated first in his class." However half-baked the story turns out to be, the funny asides and captions that Keller sprinkles throughout the book are often brilliant and the busy, crazy paintings are lots of fun, too.

They can be weapons. They can be gifts. The right words can win you friends or make you enemies. They can come back to haunt you. Sometimes they can change things forever.</p><p>When cell phones are banned at Branton Middle School, Frost and his friends Deedee, Wolf, and Bench come up with a new way to communicate: leaving sticky notes for each other all around the school. It catches on, and soon all the kids in school are leaving notes&#x2014;though for every kind and friendly one, there is a cutting and cruel one as well. </p><p>In the middle of this, a new girl named Rose arrives at school and sits at Frost&#x2019;s lunch table. Rose is not like anyone else at Branton Middle School, and it&#x2019;s clear that the close circle of friends Frost has made for himself won&#x2019;t easily hold another. As the sticky-note war escalates, and the pressure to choose sides mounts, Frost soon realizes that after this year, nothing will ever be the same.</p></p><p><p><strong>John David Anderson </strong>is the author of some of the most beloved and highly acclaimed books for kids in recent memory, including the <em>New York Times </em>Notable Book <em>Ms. Bixbys Last Day</em>, <em>Posted</em>, <em>Granted</em>, <em>Sidekicked</em>, <em>The Dungeoneers, </em>and <em>Finding Orion.</em>&nbsp;A dedicated root beer connoisseur and chocolate fiend, he lives with his wonderful wife and two frawesome kids in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hes never eaten seven scoops of ice cream in a single sitting, but he thinks it sounds like a terrific idea. You can visit him online at www.johndavidanderson.org.</p>Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Middle school can be rough, even for a tight-knit pack of 13-year-old friends. When the new girl, Rose, joins their table at lunch, things start to change in uncomfortable ways for Frost, Bench, Deedee, and Wolf. It certainly doesn't help that the sharp words and mean thoughts that used to fly around on cell phones, which have been banned, are now pasted on the school walls via sticky notes, out there for everyone to see. The eighth grade that Anderson portrays contains a good deal of hurtful words and somewhat muted violence spun from his memories of being "short and smart (but not that smart) and scrawny and often alone." Both the wit of the prose and the bullying described are sharp and speak to everyday situations in today's schools. Stylistically the novel is solid, with a repetitive emphasis on the power of words. Anderson creates crucial suspense as narrator Frost looks back on the events of the story. Regrettably, the book overhypes itself to a substantial degree: the "war" is not the advertised monumental conflict of competing sides but rather a significant backdrop for a couple of major incidents in the lives of the main characters. VERDICT A forceful book that focuses on bullying and the development of friendships in middle school amid exploration of the power of words. A good purchase for collections serving middle schoolers.&#x2014;Erin Reilly-Sanders, University of Wisconsin-Madison</p><h2>DAYBRIGHTENER - JESUS CALLING</h2><p>DAYBRIGHTENER - JESUS CALLING [spiral_bound] YOUNG, SARAH [Jan 01, 2011]</p><p></p><h2>The Care and Keeping of You Journal (Revised): for Younger Girls (American Girl)</h2><p>This companion to our bestselling book, The Care &amp; Keeping of You, received its own all-new makeover!

The books bring to the page the true story of John Lewis and many of his colleagues in the movement after the historic success of the Selma campaign. Opening two days after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, John Lewis and his colleagues are arrested and taken to jail in Americus, Georgia, as the largest hooded Klan march in years takes shape on the courthouse steps.&nbsp;<i>Run: Book One</i>&nbsp;takes readers through the behind-the-scenes struggle to exercise the hard-won rights of people of color to register, vote, and secure equal representation in their elected leaders, all the while facing escalating tensions over continued American involvement in Vietnam.</p><p><b>Congressman John Lewis</b> is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and is the US Representative for Georgia&#x2019;s Fifth Congressional District. An American icon known for his role in the civil rights movement, Lewis first joined the movement as a seminary student in Nashville, organizing sit-ins and participating in the first Freedom Ride, which challenged illegal segregation at bus stations across the South. He soon became the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and one of the &#x201c;Big Six&#x201d; national leaders of the movement, alongside such figures as Martin Luther King Jr. and A. Philip Randolph. As SNCC chairman, Lewis was an architect of, and the youngest featured speaker at, the historic 1963 March on Washington, and was a key figure in the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer. Together with Hosea Williams, Lewis led the landmark &#x201c;Bloody Sunday&#x201d; march in Selma, Alabama, where police brutality spurred national outrage and hastened passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lewis is also the author of the award-winning and #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling graphic novel memoir series <i>March</i>. John Lewis spends his time between Atlanta, Georgia, and Washington, DC.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Andrew Aydin</b> is the creator and co-author of the graphic novel memoir series, <i>March</i>. An Atlanta native, Andrew was raised by a single mother and grew up reading comic books. In 2008, Congressman Lewis mentioned to Andrew the 1957 comic book <i>Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</i> and the role it played in the early days of the civil rights movement. Recognizing the potential for a comic on Congressman Lewis&#x2019;s life to inspire young people, Andrew urged him to write a comic about his time in the movement, but Congressman Lewis had one condition: that Andrew write it with him. Collaborating with artist Nate Powell, the first volume of the <i>March </i>trilogy was published in 2013. Aydin has written for comics such as <i>Bitch Planet</i> and <i>X-Files</i> as well as for <i>Teaching Tolerance Magazine, Horn Book Review, </i>and <i>Creative Loafing</i>.

John Lewis (D-Ga.), the civil-rights hero who documented some of his story in the acclaimed graphic-novel memoir &#34;March&#34; - and who will continue to chronicle his civil rights fight in the recently announced comic book &#34;Run.&#34;&#39;&#39; Washington Post &#34;Rep.

Lewis, a civil rights hero, won the National Book Award for &#34;March: Book Three.&#34; Abrams ComicArts will publish the next book, &#34;Run: Book One&#34; in August, the publisher said in a news release.

Simple, engaging, and fun for both baby and parent, each project sheds light on how your baby is acquiring new skills&#x2014;everything from recognizing faces, voices, and shapes to understanding new words, learning to walk, and even distinguishing between right and wrong.<br><br>Whether your little research subject is a newborn, a few months old, or a toddler, these simple, surprising projects will help you see the world through your baby&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014;and discover ways to strengthen newly acquired skills during your everyday interactions.</p><p><b>Shaun Gallagher</b>, a father of three ongoing science experiments, is a writer and a former magazine and newspaper editor.&nbsp;<br><br>His books include:<br><br><ul><li><i>Experimenting With Babies: 50 Amazing Science Projects You Can Perform on Your Kid</i> (October 2013)</li><li><i>Experiments for Newlyweds: 50 Amazing Science Projects You Can Perform With Your Spouse</i> (April 2019)</li><li><i>Experimenting With Preschoolers: 50 Amazing Science Projects You Can Perform on Kids Ages 2-5</i> (winter 2019)</li></ul>He also runs the popular website Correlated.org, which analyzes statistical data to find funny and surprising correlations. He lives in northern Delaware with his wife and children.When I was a kid, I begged Santa Claus for a Radio Shack 50-in-1 Electronic Projects Kit. The kit consisted of a &#x201c;circuit board&#x201d; with numerous capacitors, resistors, LEDs, and a buzzer for auditory output. For each project, you would connect various components with wires and then flip a switch and see what happens. It was great fun, and it contributed to my continued interest in science and engineering.<br><br>Now that I&#x2019;m a parent, though, I&#x2019;ve outgrown the Radio Shack science kit and moved on to an experimental apparatus of significantly higher complexity: the baby.<br><br>My kids are the most fun, intriguing, surprising (and exhausting) research subjects I have ever had the privilege to conduct weird and wacky experiments on. I&#x2019;ve spent hours upon hours trying to figure out the optimal way to hold a baby to get him to fall asleep quickly&#x2014;only to discover, as many parents have, that what works for one baby does not work at all for another. I&#x2019;ve tried at least 20 different techniques to get a toddler to eat his peas. (The winner: &#x201c;Please,&nbsp;whatever you do, don&#x2019;t eat your peas.&#x201d;) I&#x2019;ve tracked my baby&#x2019;s acquisition of fine motor skills based on how gently he touches my face&#x2014; it progresses from painful scratching to awkward poking to soft whisker stroking. I&#x2019;ve seen how early babies&#x2019; unique personalities emerge. Even at a few weeks old, you can already sense how their gears are turning by the way they look at you and observe the world around them. And there is something especially fascinating about conducting research on babies, who are themselves conducting experiments all the time&#x2014;which typically take the form, &#x201c;What is this thing, and what does it feel like in my mouth?&#x201d;<br><br> Before you begin experimenting on your own baby using the projects in this book, it&#x2019;s important to be aware of a few caveats: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;The projects in this book are not designed to assess your baby&#x2019;s physical or mental health, intelligence, or any other aspect of his motor, cognitive, or behavioral development, nor are they intended to tell you whether your baby is developmentally on schedule or whether he measures up. Rather, they&#x2019;re intended to demonstrate principles of infant development in a fun, easy-to-digest way. So don&#x2019;t approach these projects as challenges that your baby must complete in order to keep up with the Joneses&#x2019; kid (or the Einsteins&#x2019;). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Although suggested ages and age ranges are included in the projects, they should be considered fuzzy rather than firm, so don&#x2019;t worry if your child is not able to perform a certain task described in one of the experiments. When possible, I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;included milestone information instead of a strict age range, such as &#x201c;once your baby is walking independently. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;In many of the original studies cited in this book, a number of children were tested but excluded from the results due to common problems such as fussiness, crying, or inability to complete a qualifying requirement. In some cases, certain results were excluded because a child&#x2019;s behavior was substantially different from the majority of those studied. So if you attempt an experiment, but your baby is not able to complete it or your results are quite different from those described in the study, don&#x2019;t worry! It&#x2019;s not out of the ordinary. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;In adapting published, peer-reviewed academic studies to parent-friendly exercises that require no special equipment or training, I&#x2019;ve had to take some liberties that may affect the degree to which your results line up with those of the source material. For instance, in most published studies, children are separated into groups, and each group is assigned a different condition. One group is the &#x201c;test&#x201d; group, and another is the &#x201c;control&#x201d; group, allowing the researchers to compare the results across the two groups. In many of the projects in this book, you&#x2019;ll instead conduct all of the conditions on the same child&#x2014;your baby&#x2014;separating each trial by a length of time. The former methodology is, of course, preferred in professional contexts, but because this is a book of at-home experiments, it&#x2019;s more practical for parents to simply repeat the&nbsp;experiments, rather than recruit a bunch of neighborhood babies for a well-controlled study. (If you happen to have identical twins on hand, you can more closely replicate the control and test model. Then again, you might not have that much free time.) <br><br> As you work through the 50 experiments in this book, I&nbsp; hope they give you new insight into the various fields of child development&#x2014;but most important, I hope you come away with many new insights into your own amazing little science projects.</p><h2>1972 Back In The Day - 24-page Greeting Card / Booklet with Envelope (5 x 7 Size) &#x2013; Great for Birthdays, Anniversaries, Reunions, Graduations, Client &amp; Corporate Gifts</h2><p>A twenty-four page greeting card /gift filled with special Memories from special times...

Roosevelt had served as president of the United States several years before, and he was campaigning once again for his old job.</p><p>His speech was written on fifty pages of paper that he had folded and stuck in his upper jacket pocket. Outside his hotel, Roosevelt never saw the saloonkeeper who approached him with a gun drawn. Someone in the crowd <i>did</i> see the gun and pushed the would-be assassin&#x2019;s arm away, just as the trigger was pulled. The shooter fired once and Roosevelt fell to the ground, but quickly rose. He did not know he had been hit until someone noticed a hole in his overcoat. When he reached inside his coat, he realized he had been wounded. The bulky, folded speech in his pocket, along with the steel case for his glasses, saved his life.</p><p>Although he was bleeding, Roosevelt insisted that he give the speech. The crowd could not believe that he would continue to speak rather than go to the hospital after being shot. But Roosevelt told them, &#x201c;It takes more than that to kill a bull moose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bull Moose&#x201d; was just one of the nicknames Theodore Roosevelt earned during his long career in politics. Some of the others were Teedie, TR, Teddy (a nickname he hated), and the Trust Buster. But Bull Moose was a good choice for a man who was physically strong and who was always determined to do things his way.</p><p>&#x201c;I care not what others think of what I do, but I care very much about what I think of what I do! That is character!&#x201d; he famously said. The Bull Moose was certainly a man of great character.</p><p><b>Chapter 1<br> New York Boyhood</b></p><p>In 1858, New York City was the largest city in the United States. Almost eight hundred thousand people lived there! Ships arrived at its port carrying a wide variety of goods, including fabric, clothing, and food, along with people from many countries. Horse-drawn carriages rumbled down crowded streets. And on October 27 of that year, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born there.</p><p>His father, Theodore Sr., thought the newborn was a pretty baby, but his mother, Martha, nicknamed Mittie, wasn&#x2019;t so sure. She thought her new son looked like a turtle. The Roosevelts already had a daughter named Anna. She and young Theodore were later joined by a little brother, Elliott, and then baby Corinne. For a time Mrs. Roosevelt&#x2019;s sister, Annie Bulloch, also lived with the family.</p><p>Teedie, as his parents soon called Theodore, was part of a family that had deep roots in America. The first Roosevelt had come to New York from the Netherlands in 1644. The family bought plate glass in Europe and sold it in America. Teedie&#x2019;s family was quite wealthy. Mr. Roosevelt believed in using his time and his money to help others. One of his concerns was helping orphaned children in New York City to find homes.</p><p></p><p>ROOSEVELT HOME IN NEW YORK CITY</p><p></p></p><h2>The Night Before Valentine&#39;s Day</h2><p>All the kids are getting ready for the sweetest holiday of the year!

It is impossible to discipline gently and effectively without a good understanding of the triggers of misbehavior. Far too many experts concentrate on "fixing the problem" without helping parents understand why it happened in the first place. Any discipline that focuses solely on "the solution" actually disempowers you as a parent. Remember that a good teacher has a good understanding of their subject, and to achieve this they must first take the place of the student. Understanding the reasons for your child's undesirable behavior is the starting point for knowing how to improve it. So with our student hats on, let's step into the world of the child and try to understand things from his point of view.<br><br> Do you ever tantrum? As adults we tend to refer to our own tantrums as "losing control," "exploding," or "meltdowns." Similar words are used to describe tantrums in the teenage years. The fact is that everyone, regardless of age, has to deal with overwhelming emotions from time to time, and some cope with them better than others. In fact, we often expect behavior from our kids that we are not fully capable of ourselves.<br><br> Life is difficult and confusing. We all have a lot to deal with on a daily basis, and if we as adults don't navigate the journey perfectly at all times, then we shouldn't demand that our children do. So accepting that your child will have meltdowns and tantrums, just as you do sometimes, is perhaps the best way forward. Resetting your expectations, starting with the baseline that everyone misbehaves from time to time, is a great starting point.<br><br> In chapter 3 we will look at the neurological basis of behavior and how this changes during childhood. The human brain differs dramatically from babies to teens to adults, which means it is unrealistic to expect children to behave in the same manner as adults. Perhaps the largest difference is in the area responsible for impulse control and regulation of emotions-which is why resetting expectations for behavior so that they are age appropriate is so fundamental to gentle discipline. For the remainder of this chapter, however, we will focus on nonneurological causes of undesirable behavior, although the two are always linked. There are undoubtedly environmental triggers, but a child's brain-whether she is a teen or a toddler-is not like that of an adult, and this immaturity will always play a role in her undesirable behavior, simply because she cannot control her actions as well as an adult can.<br><br> Physiological Behavior Triggers<br><br> Have you observed that particular triggers of your child's behavior are of a physiological nature? My children are all noticeably more cranky when they are tired, hungry, or when they've had too much screen time. I can also tell when they have had friendship issues or trouble at school by their behavior. Knowing their triggers allows me to prepare for, preempt, and-sometimes-avoid any related bad behavior. It also helps me to not take their behavior personally. From the child's point of view, it's useful if they can recognize and avoid triggers independently, without parental help, although it is the parents' role to teach them about these initially. While toddlers, preschoolers, and even infants might understand the negative effects of certain behaviors, it is quite unlikely that they will always be able to avoid them without parental help. But in the tween (roughly ages eight to thirteen) and teen years, children can become quite proficient at avoiding certain triggers without any adult input.<br><br> So let's explore some common behavior triggers in children of all ages. They are in no particular order, and the list is by no means complete. Remember that each child is unique, and that his or her triggers reflect this; finding your child's own particular triggers is what's most important.<br><br> Diet<br><br> For many kids, diet can play a tremendous role in their behavior, and parents often notice significant changes after focusing on this for several weeks. Despite popular opinion, sugar does not make children hyperactive. It is undoubtedly not healthy, but poor behavior is frequently wrongly blamed on a "sugar rush." Conversely, low blood sugar, or rather, low blood-glucose levels, may affect behavior. The body releases a compensatory amount of adrenaline in response to a fall in blood glucose, known as hypoglycemia. This chain of events can cause a negative change in behavior-a phenomenon sometimes referred to as being "hangry," a combination of hunger and anger, largely caused by the change in glucose and adrenaline levels. Simply making sure that children avoid becoming overly hungry can often have a positive effect on behavior.<br><br> One specific dietary factor that can have an effect on behavior is artificial additives. While the varieties are too numerous to explore in depth here, it's important to note that chemical additives, such as those found in breakfast cereals, chips, candy, juices, and even children's medicines, have been linked to hyperactivity. If you suspect your child may be affected, be sure to check the ingredients lists on the product packaging and speak to your pediatrician.<br><br> Deficiencies in diet can also play a part. In 2013, research on nearly five hundred children between seven and nine years old found that low levels of omega-3, long-chain polyunsaturated fats were associated with increased behavior problems, a lowered reading ability, and poorer memory.<br><br> If you suspect that your child's behavior may be worsened by dietary triggers, the place to start is with a food diary, noting everything your child eats and their behavior daily over a couple of weeks. This can help to provide insight into any negative reaction to foods, particularly additives. Analyzing their diet can also help to identify any nutritional deficiencies. Ideally, all of your child's nutritional needs will be met via their diet. Omega-3, for instance, can be found in oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon, and tuna, as well as flaxseeds, which can be easily added to breakfast cereals. But when that's not the case, a nutritionist can advise on supplements that might help to prevent hyperactive behavior due to dietary deficiencies.<br><br> Lack of Sleep<br><br> Have you noticed a change in your child's behavior when they are tired? Toddlers who have skipped a nap tend to be grouchy, short-tempered, and sometimes clumsy. The same is true at any age (including us adults). I can always tell when my teenager has had a late night for exactly the same reasons.<br><br> But how long should your child sleep? No one really knows. At best, experts can provide fairly broad ranges for each age; however, sleep needs are unique, and while some kids function perfectly well on eight hours' sleep in a twenty-four-hour period, others may need closer to twelve. The following table, based on advice from the National Sleep Foundation, is a good guide to sleep needs by age:<br><br> Bedtimes that are too early, as well as too late, can mean that a child will not get enough sleep. If they are put to bed before their body is biologically ready for sleep, research shows that they take longer to fall asleep and are more likely to wake overnight. A good bedtime for kids under eleven years of age is somewhere between eight and nine o'clock. Teenagers, on the other hand, are not biologically ready for sleep until much later. Research shows that the sleep patterns of thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds undergo a phase delay-that is, a tendency toward sleeping at later times. This applies to both bedtime and wake time, with a typical sleep onset time of eleven o'clock at night. The problem here is that at this age most children still need at least eight or nine hours' sleep per night, yet they are expected to get up for school. The early school start is at odds with their biological sleep needs, which invariably means that they go to school having had too little sleep-and this sleep deficit can create or contribute to many behavioral issues.<br><br> In addition to bedtimes, another major issue kids struggle with when trying to get enough sleep is lighting. Research has shown that blue, or short-wave, light sources trick the brain into thinking it is still daytime and inhibit the body's secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. Any night-lights in your child's room that are not red (in terms of the light emitted) can inhibit their sleep. Red light is the only one that does not inhibit the secretion of melatonin. And it's not just conventional lighting that causes an issue with sleep-screens such as televisions, smartphones, and tablets also emit large amounts of blue light. So these devices keep children awake due to biological responses, as well as the obvious temptation to play on them. Screens have no place in your child's bedroom, or even in the hour or two leading up to bedtime.<br><br> Sensory Overload<br><br> Have you ever felt overwhelmed by your environment? Perhaps a place filled with many different smells, loud sounds, and lots of people bumping into you? I personally find the London Underground to be a bit of an assault on my senses, and whenever I travel into London I am always grumpy and exhausted for the remainder of the day.<br><br> Many years ago, I was exhibiting at a baby show in a very large hall that was lit by rows of spotlight tracks suspended from the ceiling, bathing everything in high levels of artificial light. My stall was located next to the stage where several product demonstrations and fashion shows took place throughout the day, all accompanied by loud music, while the smells of toiletries, aromatherapy, and curry from a nearby food stall filled the air. At least a thousand people attended, jostling one another and navigating strollers and baby gear through the busier areas. At the end of each day's exhibiting, I went home with a pounding headache due to the sensory overload, while almost all of the visitors at my stall complained that their children were grumpy, grizzly, and irritable, although most greeted me with, "Hi, I'm sorry, I don't know why my child is so unhappy." I told them all to look up at the bright lights and imagine how they would feel if they were reclining in a stroller and staring at them throughout their visit. Then I asked them to imagine being surrounded by hundreds of pairs of legs bumping into them and trying to sleep through the throbbing music and the cries of other children in their ears. And then I asked if they would feel irritable in the same situation. Sometimes stepping into the shoes of your child can give you all the answers you need.<br><br> Now imagine how your child feels when she starts school for the first time at the age of four or five. At nursery or preschool she was used to a small space and probably fewer children. Once they start school they are, for one thing, the youngest, usually out of at least a hundred children. The buildings are bigger and the sounds amplified. Is it any wonder that they struggle with feelings of being totally overwhelmed?<br><br> Imagine going through all of this again at the age of eleven. Starting middle school is by far the most difficult transition for most kids. If you found yourself in a new environment and battling to make sense of it all, you might find that you were grumpy and short tempered at the end of the day too. And imagine that you've been trying hard to "keep it together" all day, but now that you're home, with those you love and trust, you can finally "let it all out" and release your authentic emotions.<br><br> So many children go through this when they start a new school, yet their parents don't understand why they are irritable and "naughty" when they get home. They complain of school reports that speak of a child who's polite and mature, yet at home they are anything but. This behavior is common and understandable-the child is finally home from day care or school and feels it is safe to drop the fa ade in the presence of people she loves and trusts. For parents this can be hard to handle, especially if they believe that the child is being "naughty on purpose." In fact, her behavior shows what a great job the parents are doing, by making the child feel secure and supported enough to be able to show her true emotions.<br><br> While most children will battle with feelings of being overwhelmed at particular moments and transitions, there are others who struggle on a daily basis. Research has shown that one out of six children experiences auditory and tactile sensory symptoms serious enough to negatively impact everyday life. Further research conducted in the United States has shown that one in twenty children experiences sensory processing disorder (SPD), often described as a disorganization of sensory signals and responses in the brain, affecting different senses. Children with SPD may find it harder to process auditory or tactile stimuli or cope with sensations. This can manifest in either an over- or an underresponse. For instance, some children may find it very hard to cope with certain fabrics touching their skin, to the point where they find it unbearable. Some may find certain lighting or sounds disturbing and some may not process certain sensations, such as heat and cold, and thus expose themselves to dangerous situations. No one cause of SPD is known; however, it is likely to be a result of a combination of genetics and environmental influences and situations.<br><br> Symptoms of SPD are often found on a spectrum, with some more severe than others. As babies and toddlers, children with SPD are often described as "fussy" or "very high need." They can often struggle with sleep and eating and may cry to be held, but then arch away once in their parents' arms. They can also often be extremely active, yet slow to achieve physical milestones; in the toddler years, toilet training can be very difficult. As they grow up, eating and sleeping problems may continue and they can experience more tantrums than average as they strive to cope with stimulation. Body contact with others can be challenging too and they are said to "overreact" to different experiences. They can often seem to be uncoordinated and find it hard to master fine motor skills.<br><br> Treatment for SPD is multifaceted and often involves occupational therapy and a therapeutic, sensory-rich environment to help to challenge children in a fun and safe way. Many parents also report success with alternative approaches with complementary therapies. Sensory objects that can help a child to cope on an everyday basis, especially at school, include special "chewy" jewelry, stress balls, and "fiddle" objects that aid concentration and fulfill their sensory needs in a socially acceptable way.</p><h2>I Spy Little Book</h2><p><b>Search-and-find riddles paired with amazing photographs will captivate kids of all ages in the bestselling <i>I Spy</i> series.</b><br><br>Filled with fun photos from the original <i>I Spy</i> series, the <i>I Spy</i> little board books build reading and recognition skills.<br><br>Preschoolers can search for intriguing toys and trinkets as the picture clues and rhyming riddles guide them through the delightful puzzles.</p><p>There's certainly not much imagination in the I Spy books, but every parent knows that they are ideal material for getting a 2- or 3-year-old through a restaurant meal or a trip.

Her books include the Scaredy Squirrel, Chester and Learning With Animals series, Augustine, Leon the Chameleon and Have I Got a Book for You! She lives near Montreal.</p>Gr. 1-3. In a tongue-in-cheek tale that may help to prod anxious readers out of their hidebound routines, a squirrel discovers the pleasures of leaping into the unknown. As the world's a scary place, what with the killer bees, green Martians, tarantulas, germs, and sharks that might be lurking about, Scaredy Squirrel keeps to his tree, and to a precise, minute-by-minute daily schedule--until a supposed "killer bee" actually wanders by, causing Squirrel to dislodge his suitcase-size emergency kit. A wild lunge to rescue it turns into a long glide (portrayed in a gatefold), as Squirrel discovers to his astonishment that he is a flying squirrel. Eventually, Squirrel returns in triumph to his tree and from then on adds a daily glide to his accustomed rounds. Despite the simply drawn cartoons and brief text, this is more sophisticated in tone than Martin Waddell's <i>Tiny's Big Adventure</i> (2004), though the message is similar. <i>John Peters</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Posing is truly a crucial skill that photographers need to have in order to create great photographs.

If you can look out for and avoid these five things, your skills (and your images) will quickly improve. Next, Lindsay dives into &#x201c;posing essentials,&#x201d; outlining her approach to start with a &#x201c;base pose,&#x201d; then build on that to create endless posing opportunities.

My name is Luke."<br><br>He was sure no one could hear. His roommates were all asleep, and even if they weren't, there was no way the sound of his name could travel even the short distance to the bed above or beside him. He was fairly certain there were no bugs on him or in his room. He'd looked. But even if he'd missed seeing a microphone hidden in a mattress button or carved into the headboard, how could a microphone pick up a whisper he could barely hear himself?<br><br>He was safe now. Lying in bed, wide awake while everyone else slept, he reassured himself of that fact constantly. But his heart pounded and his face went clammy with fear every time he rounded his lips for that "u" sound -- instead of the fake smile of the double "e" in Lee, the name he had to force himself to answer to now.<br><br>It was better to forget, to never speak his real name again.<br><br>But he'd lost everything else. Even just mouthing his name was a comfort. It seemed like his only link now to his past, to his parents, his brothers.<br><br>To Jen.<br><br>By day, he kept his mouth shut.<br><br>He couldn't help it.<br><br>That first day, walking up the stairs of the Hendricks School for Boys with Jen's father, Luke had felt his jaw clench tighter and tighter the closer he got to the front door.<br><br>"Oh, don't look like that," Mr. Talbot had said, pretending to be jolly. "It's not reform school or anything."<br><br>The word stuck in Luke's brain. Reform. Re-form. Yes, they were going to re-form him. They were going to take a Luke and make him a Lee.<br><br>It was safe to be Lee. It wasn't safe to be Luke.<br><br>Jen's father stood with his hand on the ornate doorknob, waiting for a reply. But Luke couldn't have said a word if his life depended on it.<br><br>Jen's father hesitated, then pulled on the heavy door. They walked down a long hallway. The ceiling was so far away, Luke thought he could have stood his entire family on his shoulders -- one on top of the other, Dad and Mother and Matthew and Mark -- and the highest one still would barely touch. The walls were lined, floor to ceiling, with old paintings of people in costumes Luke had never seen outside of books.<br><br>Of course, there was very little he'd ever seen outside of books.<br><br>He tried not to stare, because if he really were Lee, surely everything would look familiar and ordinary. But that was hard to remember. They passed a classroom where dozens of boys sat in orderly rows, everyone facing away from the door. Luke gawked for so long that he practically began walking backwards. He'd known there were a lot of people in the world, but he'd never been able to imagine so many all in one place at the same time. Were any of them shadow children with fake identities, like Luke?<br><br>Jen's father clapped a hand on his shoulder, turning him around.<br><br>"Ah, here's the headmaster's office," Mr. Talbot said heartily. "Just what we were looking for."<br><br>Luke nodded, still mute, and followed him through a tall doorway.<br><br>A woman sitting behind a mammoth wood desk turned their way. She took one look at Luke and asked, "New boy?"<br><br>"Lee Grant," Jen's father said. "I spoke with the master about him last night."<br><br>"It's the middle of the semester, you know," she said warningly. "Unless he's very well prepared, he shan't catch up, and might have to repeat -- "<br><br>"That won't be a problem," Mr. Talbot assured her. Luke was glad he didn't have to speak for himself. He knew he wasn't well prepared. He wasn't prepared for anything.<br><br>The woman was already reaching for files and papers.<br><br>"His parents faxed in his medical information and his insurance standing and his academic records last night," she said. "But someone needs to sign these -- "<br><br>Jen's father took the stack of papers as if he autographed other people's documents all the time.<br><br>Probably he did.<br><br>Luke watched Mr. Talbot flip through the papers, scrawling his name here, crossing out a word or a phrase or a whole paragraph there. Luke was sure Jen's father was going too fast to actually read any of it.<br><br>And that was when the homesickness hit Luke for the first time. He could just picture his own father peering cautiously at important papers, reading them over and over before he even picked up a pen. Luke could see his father's rheumy eyes squinted in concentration, his brow furrowed with anxiety.<br><br>He was always so afraid of being tricked.<br><br>Maybe Jen's father didn't care.<br><br>Luke had to swallow hard then. He made a gulping noise, and the woman looked at him. Luke couldn't read her expression. Curiosity? Contempt? Indifference?<br><br>He didn't think it was sympathy.<br><br>Jen's father finished then, handing the papers back to the woman with a flourish.<br><br>"I'll call a boy to show you your room," the woman said to Luke.<br><br>Luke nodded. The woman leaned over a box on her desk and said, "Mr. Dirk, could you send Rolly Sturgeon to the office?"<br><br>Luke heard a roar along with the man's reply, "Yes, Ms. Hawkins," as if all the boys in the school were laughing and cheering and hissing at once. Luke felt his legs go weak with fear. When this Rolly Sturgeon showed up, Luke wasn't sure he'd be able to walk.<br><br>"Well, I'll be off," Jen's father said. "Duty calls."<br><br>He stuck out his hand and after a moment Luke realized he was supposed to shake it. But he'd never shaken hands with anyone before, so he put out the wrong hand first. Jen's father frowned, moving his head violently side to side, and glaring pointedly at the woman behind the desk. Fortunately, she wasn't watching. Luke recovered. He clumsily touched his hand to Jen's father's.<br><br>"Good luck," Jen's father said, bringing his other hand up to Luke's, too.<br><br>Only when Mr. Talbot had pulled both hands away did Luke realize he'd placed a tiny scrap of paper between Luke's fingers. Luke held it there until the woman turned her back. Then he slid it into his pocket.<br><br>Jen's father smiled.<br><br>"Keep those grades up," he said. "And no running away this time, you hear?"<br><br>Luke gulped again, and nodded. And then Jen's father left without a backward glance.<br><br>Copyright � 2001 by Margaret Peterson Haddix</p><h2>180 Days of Reading: Grade 3 - Daily Reading Workbook for Classroom and Home, Reading Comprehension and Phonics Practice, School Level Activities Created by Teachers to Master Challenging Concepts</h2><p>Regular practice is the best way to reinforce concepts and allow students to gain confidence and mastery of skills.

To say it was just a good wedgie would be a serious understatement, though. My tighty-whities were so far up my back I could feel the Fruit of the Loom tag scratching my neck. My underwear stretched so much that you could've put Jeffrey in there with me. No, it wasn't just a good wedgie. I was the victim of one of the greatest wedgies of all time, one that deserved a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Not the sort of thing you want to be known for, but, if I'm being honest, I'd asked for it.<br><br> My claim to fame happened at the two-week summer wrestling camp that Jeffrey and I attended together. The camp was definitely the highlight of my vacation. Mr. T had told us that he'd gone to his first camp as a rising seventh grader, and since we were planning to join the school team in the winter, he encouraged us to do the same, and told our parents that it would be a good idea. Mr. T helped us pick the camp and even drove Jeffrey and me there on the day it started. It took place on a college campus I'd never heard of but featured some of the best coaches in the country.<br><br> After we were all checked in and settled in our room, Mr. T brought us back to his car and opened the trunk. "I've got something for each of you, now that you're officially wrestlers," he said. He pulled out a pair of his old wrestling shoes and handed them to me. "These babies aren't used to losing matches, so you'd best take care of them," he told me.<br><br> I couldn't even get a thank-you out of my mouth. I held those shoes like Jessica cradles her books.<br><br> He passed his old headgear on to Jeffrey, who couldn't manage to say anything, either.<br><br> "If you pay attention, I know you'll learn plenty," Mr. T promised us. "I discovered some of my best moves at camp. Have fun, work hard, and stick together. And stay out of trouble," he added, looking at me. He closed the trunk and climbed into his car. "I'll see you in ten days." Then he drove away.<br><br> I did a pretty good job of following his advice. I paid attention, worked hard, and stuck with Jeffrey. But I did manage to get myself in a little bit of trouble--I couldn't help it.<br><br> One of my favorite parts of camp was the dorm. I'd never been away from home like this before. It was great. There was no one harping on us to clean our room. Jeffrey and I kept the place as messy as we wanted. It was also really cool having other kids in the dorm with us. There were ten rooms in our hall, twenty boys total, and Jeffrey and I were the youngest. I used to think the bathroom at school was the best place for messing around, but the dorm was heaven. You could get away with murder.<br><br> We were at our morning session, sitting along the mats and changing into our wrestling shoes, when Max, one of the kids a few doors down from Jeffrey and me, started freaking out.<br><br> "Eww!" he yelled. "What the heck!" He yanked his shoe off and tipped it over. Shampoo dripped from inside it. Max tossed his sneaker aside, ripped his sock off, and chucked it at Matt, who was cracking up. Matt and his roommate, Josh, were the oldest kids on our floor, which made them the alpha males--or so they thought. I wouldn't say they were mean, but they definitely liked pulling pranks and picking on the younger kids in the pack. They slapped high five and kept laughing their heads off. Poor Max had no choice but to wrestle that session in his bare feet. By the end of practice, they were covered in so many mat burns he could hardly walk.<br><br> Let the wars begin, I thought. Jeffrey must've seen my wheels spinning. "Don't even think about it, Peter," he warned me. "Remember what Terupt told you." I might've taken his advice, but later that night, Matt left me with no choice but to get involved.<br><br> I had just finished in the shower and went to grab my towel, but it was gone. Someone had swiped it when I wasn't looking and had left me a tiny little washcloth in its place. I was soaking wet, but what could I do? I held the washcloth in front of my waist like a matador and booked it down the hall. My front was covered, but my naked butt shone like a full moon. I thought I was going to make it, but when I reached my room I found the door locked. I pounded on it.<br><br> "Jeffrey!" I yelled.<br><br> No answer. Then I heard a door at the end of the hall open and close. I didn't even have to look. I knew it was them.<br><br> "Hey, nice butt!" Josh yelled. "And cute towel. Perfect for a little guy like you."<br><br> I pulled the washcloth tight to my front. "Some jerk took mine and left me with this," I said.<br><br> "You don't say. And now you're locked out. Boy, that stinks," he teased.<br><br> "Shut up!" I said.<br><br> "Tough words from a naked boy."<br><br> "Out of my way, little man," Matt said, shoving me as the two of them passed by. "The ladies await. It's time for Matt's Gun Show." He flexed his biceps and strutted toward the exit.<br><br> There happened to be a field hockey camp also taking place at the college, so there were girls everywhere. One thing I know about girls is that they always go for the bigger, older-looking guys, and, for once, that was a relief. Thanks to the girls, Matt and Josh didn't have time to torture me at the moment.<br><br> Jeffrey showed up a few minutes later, carrying a bag of chips from the vending machine. "Whoa! Where's your towel?" he said.<br><br> "Just let me in." I'd gone from relieved to annoyed.</p><h2>Stories for Boys Who Dare to Be Different: True Tales of Amazing Boys Who Changed the World without Killing Dragons (The Dare to Be Different Series)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestseller<br></b><b><br></b><b>Boys can be anything they want to be!

(What Was?)</h2><p><b>Discover the true story of the Twin Towers&#x2014;how they came to be the tallest buildings in the world and why they were destroyed.</b><br><br>When the Twin Towers were built in 1973, they were billed as an architectural wonder. At 1,368 feet, they clocked in as the tallest buildings in the world and changed the New York City skyline dramatically. Offices and corporations moved into the towers&#x2014;also known as the World Trade Center&#x2014;and the buildings were seen as the economic hub of the world. But on September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack toppled the towers and changed our nation forever. Discover the whole story of the Twin Towers&#x2014;from their ambitious construction to their tragic end.</p><p>Jim O'Connor is the author of <i>What Was Pompeii?</i>, <i>What Was the Battle of Gettysburg?</i>, and <i>Who Is Bob Dylan?</i><b>What Were the Twin Towers?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was a perfect end-of-summer morning in New York City. The sky was a clear, rich blue and there were no clouds.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the tip of Manhattan, by 8:20 a.m., people were streaming in from subways and from Staten Island ferryboats. The World Trade Center&#x2019;s Twin Towers gleamed in the sunlight. The North Tower and the South Tower. Some office workers lingered in the tree-lined plaza at the base of the buildings. <br> &nbsp;<br> Many people were already upstairs at their desks starting work. At the famous Windows on the World restaurant, several companies were hosting business breakfasts. The restaurant was in the North Tower, on the 106th and 107th floors. The view was spectacular that morning. Diners could see more than fifty miles in any direction.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was just another normal morning. Then at 8:46, everything changed. People on the street heard a roar. They looked up to see a jet airplane overhead. It was flying low, dangerously low. And it was heading straight toward the North Tower. In a matter of seconds, it slammed into floors ninety-three through ninety-nine. <br> &nbsp;<br> This was the first blow of a terrible attack on the United States of America. In the next seventy-seven minutes, a second plane hit the South Tower. A third plane flew into the Pentagon building just outside of Washington, DC. A fourth plane crashed in central Pennsylvania. Everyone in all four planes was killed, including the nineteen men who had hijacked the flights and carried out the attacks.<br> &nbsp;<br> By 10:28 that morning, both towers had collapsed, killing 2,606 innocent people. Another 125 died at the Pentagon. In all, 2,977 died on September 11, 2001, counting the passengers and crew on all four planes.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the months and years that followed, there would be more victims. Many were rescue workers&#x2014;police officers and firefighters&#x2014;as well as construction workers who came to clean up the site. They became sick from breathing the polluted air while working at Ground Zero. That became the name for the area where the Twin Towers had once stood.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why were the Twin Towers targeted? Who was behind the attack? And how did that terrible day change the United States? <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Chapter 1:&nbsp;Money, Money, Money&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> More than any other city in the United States, New York has always been a center of business. In America in the 1600s and 1700s, many colonies were founded by groups seeking religious freedom. But not New York. It began as a Dutch trading post called New Amsterdam. Its purpose was to make money.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Dutch took advantage of the large natural harbor that stayed ice-free all winter. This meant that ships with cargo could come and go all year. And the Hudson River, to the west of New Amsterdam, offered a route to fur trading posts farther inland.<br> &nbsp;<br> The British forced the Dutch out of New Amsterdam in 1664 and renamed it New York. They stayed over a hundred years, until the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783. After that, New York City became the trading center of a new, young country: the United States of America.<br> &nbsp;<br> Manhattan, where New York City began, is an island. Because of that, over time six bridges as well as four tunnels&#x2014;two under the East River and two under the Hudson&#x2014;were constructed to connect Manhattan to mainland areas. Many of these transportation routes are overseen by an agency called the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey. It has control over the port, covering a twenty-five-mile circle, with the Statue of Liberty at the center. Tolls from bridges and tunnels provide the money for more new projects. In the middle of the twentieth century, the Port Authority headed the biggest building project in New York&#x2019;s history&#x2014;the construction of two skyscrapers, each 110 stories. They were the tallest buildings on the planet&#x2014;at least for a while.</p><h2>Your First 365 Days in Real Estate: How to build a successful real estate business (starting with nothing)</h2><p>Your successful career in real estate starts here!<br><br>The first 365 days of working in real estate can be one of the most tumultuous times in your career - full of hard lessons, heart breaks and hard work.

Most executives manage their companies as if the solution to that problem lies in the external environment: find an attractive market, formulate the right strategy, win new customers. <br><br>But when Bain &amp; Company&#x2019;s Chris Zook and James Allen, authors of the bestselling <i>Profit from the Core</i>, researched this question, they found that when companies fail to achieve their growth targets, 90 percent of the time the root causes are internal, not external increasing distance from the front lines, loss of accountability, proliferating processes and bureaucracy, to name only a few. What&#x2019;s more, companies experience a set of predictable internal crises, at predictable stages, as they grow. Even for healthy companies, these crises, if not managed properly, stifle the ability to grow further and can actively lead to decline.<br><br>The key insight from Zook and Allen&#x2019;s research is that managing these choke points requires a founder&#x2019;s mentality&#x201d; behaviors typically embodied by a bold, ambitious founder to restore speed, focus, and connection to customers:<br><br> An insurgent&#x2019;s clear mission and purpose<br> An unambiguous owner mindset<br> A relentless obsession with the front line<br><br>Based on the authors&#x2019; decade-long study of companies in more than forty countries, <i>The Founder&#x2019;s Mentality</i> demonstrates the strong relationship between these three traits in companies of all kinds not just start-ups and their ability to sustain performance. Through rich analysis and inspiring examples, this book shows how any leader not only a founder can instill and leverage a founder&#x2019;s mentality throughout their organization and find lasting, profitable growth.<br></p><p><b>Chris Zook</b> is a partner at Bain &amp; Company and has been co-head of the firm&#x2019;s Global Strategy practice for twenty years.

Change is in the air and technology is on the rise, but business is still a human pursuit, and should be humane. In a media climate dominated by Twitterstorms and sound bites, it is important to dive deeper into the issues and inform ourselves more fully before taking action. These books help do that.&#x201d; <b>Editorial Director Dylan Schleicher on the 800-CEO-READ 2016 Business Book of the Year Longlist, which includes <i>THE FOUNDER&#x2019;S MENTALITY</i></b><br><br> As a founder myself, I get it.

The girls played it all the time in their cabin at Camp Nightingale. Vivian, Natalie, Allison, and first-time camper Emma Davis, the youngest of the group. But the games ended the night Emma sleepily watched the others sneak out of the cabin into the darkness. The last she--or anyone--saw of them was Vivian closing the cabin door behind her, hushing Emma with a finger pressed to her lips.<br><br>Now a rising star in the New York art scene, Emma turns her past into paintings--massive canvases filled with dark leaves and gnarled branches that cover ghostly shapes in white dresses. When the paintings catch the attention of Francesca Harris-White, the wealthy owner of Camp Nightingale, she implores Emma to return to the newly reopened camp as a painting instructor. Seeing an opportunity to find out what really happened to her friends all those years ago, Emma agrees.<br><br>Familiar faces, unchanged cabins, and the same dark lake haunt Nightingale, even though the camp is opening its doors for the first time since the disappearances. Emma is even assigned to the same cabin she slept in as a teenager, but soon discovers a security camera--the only one on the property--pointed directly at its door. Then cryptic clues that Vivian left behind about the camp's twisted origins begin surfacing. As she digs deeper, Emma finds herself sorting through lies from the past while facing mysterious threats in the present. And the closer she gets to the truth about Camp Nightingale and what really happened to those girls, the more she realizes that closure could come at a deadly price.</p><p><i>The Last Time I Lied </i>is the second thriller from <b>Riley Sager</b>, the pseudonym of an author who lives in Princeton, New Jersey. Riley's first novel, <i>Final Girls</i>, was a national and international bestseller that has been published in more than two-dozen countries.1<br><br>I paint the girls in the same order.<br><br>Vivian first.<br><br>Then Natalie.<br><br>Allison is last, even though she was first to leave the cabin and therefore technically the first to disappear.<br><br>My paintings are typically large. Massive, really. As big as a barn door, Randall likes to say. Yet the girls are always small. Inconsequential marks on a canvas that's alarmingly wide.<br><br>Their arrival heralds the second stage of a painting, after I've laid down a background of earth and sky in hues with appropriately dark names. Spider black. Shadow gray. Blood red.<br><br>And midnight blue, of course. In my paintings, there's always a bit of midnight.<br><br>Then come the girls, sometimes clustered together, sometimes scattered to far-flung corners of the canvas. I put them in white dresses that flare at the hems, as if they're running from something. They're usually turned so all that can be seen of them is their hair trailing behind them as they flee. On the rare occasions when I do paint a glimpse of their faces, it's only the slimmest of profiles, nothing more than a single curved brushstroke.<br><br>I create the woods last, using a putty knife to slather paint onto the canvas in wide, unwieldy strokes. This process can take days, even weeks, me slightly dizzy from fumes as I glob on more paint, layer upon layer, keeping it thick.<br><br>I've heard Randall boast to potential buyers that my surfaces are like Van Gogh's, with paint cresting as high as an inch off the canvas. I prefer to think I paint like nature, where true smoothness is a myth, especially in the woods. The chipped ridges of tree bark. The speckle of moss on rock. Several autumns' worth of leaves coating the ground. That's the nature I try to capture with my scrapes and bumps and whorls of paint.<br><br>So I add more and more, each wall-size canvas slowly succumbing to the forest of my imagination. Thick. Forbidding. Crowded with danger. The trees loom, dark and menacing. Vines don't creep so much as coil, their loops tightening into choke holds. Underbrush covers the forest floor. Leaves blot out the sky.<br><br>I paint until there's not a bare patch left on the canvas and the girls have been consumed by the forest, buried among the trees and vines and leaves, rendered invisible. Only then do I know a painting is finished, using the tip of a brush handle to swirl my name into the lower right-hand corner.<br><br>Emma Davis.<br><br>That same name, in that same borderline-illegible script, now graces a wall of the gallery, greeting visitors as they pass through the hulking sliding doors of this former warehouse in the Meatpacking District. Every other wall is filled with paintings. My paintings. Twenty-seven of them.<br><br>My first gallery show.<br><br>Randall has gone all out for the opening party, turning the place into a sort of urban forest. There are rust-colored walls and birch trees cut from a forest in New Jersey arranged in tasteful clumps. Ethereal house music throbs discreetly in the background. The lighting suggests October even though it's a week until St. Patrick's Day and outside the streets are piled with dirty slush.<br><br>The gallery is packed, though. I'll give Randall that. Collectors, critics, and lookyloos elbow for space in front of the canvases, champagne glasses in hand, reaching every so often for the mushroom-and-goat-cheese croquettes that float by. Already I've been introduced to dozens of people whose names I've instantly forgotten. People of importance. Important enough for Randall to whisper who they are in my ear as I shake their hands.<br><br>"From the Times," he says of a woman dressed head to toe in shades of purple. Of a man in an impeccably tailored suit and bright red sneakers, he simply whispers, "Christie's."<br><br>"Very impressive work," Mr. Christie's says, giving me a crooked smile. "They're so bold."<br><br>There's surprise in his voice, as if women are somehow incapable of boldness. Or maybe his surprise stems from the fact that, in person, I'm anything but bold. Compared with other outsize personalities in the art world, I'm positively demure. No all-purple ensemble or flashy footwear for me. Tonight's little black dress and black pumps with a kitten heel are as fancy as I get. Most days I dress in the same combination of khakis and paint-specked T-shirts. My only jewelry is the silver charm bracelet always wrapped around my left wrist. Hanging from it are three charms-tiny birds made of brushed pewter.<br><br>I once told Randall I dress so plainly because I want my paintings to stand out and not the other way around. In truth, boldness in one's personality and appearance seems futile to me.<br><br>Vivian was bold in every way.<br><br>It didn't keep her from disappearing.<br><br>During these meet and greets, I smile as wide as instructed, accept compliments, coyly defer the inevitable questions about what I plan to do next.<br><br>Once Randall has exhausted his supply of strangers to introduce, I hang back from the crowd, willing myself not to check each painting for the telltale red sticker signaling it's been sold. Instead, I nurse a glass of champagne in a corner, the branch of a recently deforested birch tapping against my shoulder as I look around the room for people I actually know. There are many, which makes me grateful, even though it's strange seeing them together in the same place. High school friends mingling with coworkers from the ad agency, fellow painters standing next to relatives who took the train in from Connecticut.<br><br>All of them, save for a single cousin, are men.<br><br>That's not entirely an accident.<br><br>I perk up once Marc arrives fashionably late, sporting a proud grin as he surveys the scene. Although he claims to loathe the art world, Marc fits in perfectly. Bearded with adorably mussed hair. A plaid sport coat thrown over his worn Mickey Mouse T-shirt. Red sneakers that make Mr. Christie's do a disappointed double take. Passing through the crowd, Marc snags a glass of champagne and one of the croquettes, which he pops into his mouth and chews thoughtfully.<br><br>"The cheese saves it," he informs me. "But those watery mushrooms are a major infraction."<br><br>"I haven't tried one yet," I say. "Too nervous."<br><br>Marc puts a hand on my shoulder, steadying me. Just like he used to do when we lived together during art school. Every person, especially artists, needs a calming influence. For me, that person is Marc Stewart. My voice of reason. My best friend. My probable husband if not for the fact that we both like men.<br><br>I'm drawn to the romantically unattainable. Again, not a coincidence.<br><br>"You're allowed to enjoy this, you know," he says.<br><br>"I know."<br><br>"And you can be proud of yourself. There's no need to feel guilty. Artists are supposed to be inspired by life experiences. That's what creativity is all about."<br><br>Marc's talking about the girls, of course. Buried inside every painting. Other than me, only he knows about their existence. The only thing I haven't told him is why, fifteen years later, I continue to make them vanish over and over.<br><br>That's one thing he's better off not knowing.<br><br>I never intended to paint this way. In art school, I was drawn to simplicity in both color and form. Andy Warhol's soup cans. Jasper Johns's flags. Piet Mondrian's bold squares and rigid black lines. Then came an assignment to paint a portrait of someone I knew who had died.<br><br>I chose the girls.<br><br>I painted Vivian first, because she burned brightest in my memory. That blond hair right out of a shampoo ad. Those incongruously dark eyes that looked black in the right light. The pert nose sprayed with freckles brought out by the sun. I put her in a white dress with an elaborate Victorian collar fanning around her swanlike neck and gave her the same enigmatic smile she displayed on her way out of the cabin.<br><br>You're too young for this, Em.<br><br>Natalie came next. High forehead. Square chin. Hair pulled tight in a ponytail. Her white dress got a dainty lace collar that downplayed her thick neck and broad shoulders.<br><br>Finally, there was Allison, with her wholesome look. Apple cheeks and slender nose. Brows two shades darker than her flaxen hair, so thin and perfect they looked like they had been drawn on with brown pencil. I painted an Elizabethan ruff around her neck, frilly and regal.<br><br>Yet there was something wrong with the finished painting. Something that gnawed at me until the night before the project was due, when I awoke at 2:00 a.m. and saw the three of them staring at me from across the room.<br><br>Seeing them. That was the problem.<br><br>I crept out of bed and approached the canvas. I grabbed a brush, dabbed it in some brown paint, and smeared a line over their eyes. A tree branch, blinding them. More branches followed. Then plants and vines and whole trees, all of them gliding off the brush onto the canvas, as if sprouting there. By dawn, most of the canvas had been besieged by forest. All that remained of Vivian, Natalie, and Allison were shreds of their white dresses, patches of skin, locks of hair.<br><br>That became No. 1. The first in my forest series. The only one where even a fraction of the girls is visible. That piece, which got the highest grade in the class after I explained its meaning to my instructor, is absent from the gallery show. It hangs in my loft, not for sale.<br><br>Most of the others are here, though, with each painting taking up a full wall of the multichambered gallery. Seeing them together like this, with their gnarled branches and vibrant leaves, makes me realize how obsessive the whole endeavor is. Knowing I've spent years painting the same subject unnerves me.<br><br>"I am proud," I tell Marc before taking a sip of champagne.<br><br>He downs his glass in one gulp and grabs a fresh one. "Then what's up? You seem vexed."<br><br>He says it with a reedy British accent, a dead-on impersonation of Vincent Price in that campy horror movie neither of us can remember the name of. All we know is that we were stoned when we watched it on TV one night, and the line made us howl with laughter. We say it to each other far too often.<br><br>"It's just weird. All of this." I use my champagne flute to gesture at the paintings dominating the walls, the people lined up in front of them, Randall kissing both cheeks of a svelte European couple who just walked through the door. "I never expected any of this."<br><br>I'm not being humble. It's the truth. If I had expected a gallery show, I would have actually named my work. Instead, I simply numbered them in the order they were painted. No. 1 through No. 33.<br><br>Randall, the gallery, this surreal opening reception-all of it is a happy accident. The product of being in the right place at the right time. That right place, incidentally, was Marc's bistro in the West Village. At the time, I was in my fourth year of being the in-house artist at an ad agency. It was neither enjoyable nor fulfilling, but it paid the rent on a crumbling loft big enough to fit my forest canvases. After an overhead pipe leaked into the bistro, Marc needed something to temporarily mask a wall's worth of water damage. I loaned him No. 8 because it was the biggest and able to cover the most square footage.<br><br>That right time was a week later, when the owner of a small gallery a few blocks away popped into Marc's place for lunch. He saw the painting, was suitably intrigued, and asked Marc about the artist.<br><br>That led to one of my paintings-No. 7-being displayed in the gallery. It sold within a week. The owner asked for more. I gave him three. One of the paintings-lucky No. 13-caught the eye of a young art lover who posted a picture of it on Instagram. That picture was noticed by her employer, a television actress known for setting trends. She bought the painting and hung it in her dining room, showing it off during a dinner party for a small group of friends. One of those friends, an editor at Vogue, told his cousin, the owner of a larger, more prestigious gallery. That cousin is Randall, who currently roams the gallery, coiling his arms around every guest he sees.<br><br>What none of them knows-not Randall, not the actress, not even Marc-is that those thirty-three canvases are the only things I've painted outside my duties at the ad agency. There are no fresh ideas percolating in this artist's brain, no inspiration sparking me into productivity. I've attempted other things, of course, more from a nagging sense of responsibility than actual desire. But I'm never able to move beyond those initial, halfhearted efforts. I return to the girls every damn time.<br><br>I know I can't keep painting them, losing them in the woods again and again. To that end, I've vowed not to paint another. There won't be a No. 34 or a No. 46 or, God forbid, a No. 112.<br><br>That's why I don't answer when everyone asks me what I'm working on next. I have no answer to give.

But by third grade, after spending much time in her public library in Portland, Oregon, she found her skills had greatly improved. Before long, her school librarian was saying that she should write children's books when she grew up.</p><p>Instead she became a librarian. When a young boy asked her, "Where are the books about kids like us?" she remembered her teacher's encouragement and was inspired to write the books she'd longed to read but couldn't find when she was younger. She based her funny stories on her own neighborhood experiences and the sort of children she knew. And so, the Klickitat Street gang was born!</p><p>Mrs. Cleary's books have earned her many prestigious awards, including the American Library Association's Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, presented to her in recognition of her lasting contribution to children's literature. <em>Dear Mr. Henshaw</em> won the Newbery Medal, and <em>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</em> and <em>Ramona and Her Father</em> have been named Newbery Honor Books.

Up until then the Allied forces had suffered serious defeats, yet D -Day, as the invasion was called, spelled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany and the Third Reich. Readers will dive into the heart of the action and discover how it was planned and carried out and how it overwhelmed the Germans who had been tricked into thinking the attack would take place elsewhere.&nbsp;D-Day was a major turning point in World War II and hailed as one of the greatest military attacks of all time.</p><p>Patricia Brennan Demuth is the author of&nbsp;<i>Who Was Bill Gates?,&nbsp;What Was Ellis Island?,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>What Was Pearl Harbor?</i><p><b>What Was D-Day?</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>June 6, 1944</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In the dark hours before dawn, a giant war fleet was sailing across the English Channel to France. There were over 5,000 ships and boats of all shapes and sizes. More than 155,000 soldiers were on board&#x2014;mostly American, British, and Canadian. They were called the Allies. <i>Allies</i> means friends joined together in a cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another huge Allied force had just flown over the channel to France, filling 11,000 airplanes. All of these soldiers, on boats and in planes, were risking their lives to invade Europe and end World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Second World War had been raging for five years. It had started in 1939 when Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi (NAHT-see) Germany, invaded Poland. Now more than thirty nations were part of the war. The Germans had overtaken nearly all of mainland Europe. And World War II had become the bloodiest war that ever was.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Allies were fighting Hitler. But so far, they had almost no troops on the ground in Europe&#x2014;let alone in Germany itself. There was only one way the Allies could defeat Nazi Germany and free Europe. They had to fight&#x2014;and beat&#x2014;Hitler on his home ground.<br> &nbsp;<br> But how?<br> &nbsp;<br> First the Allies had to land a huge army on the coast of France&#x2014;plus tanks, trucks, and supplies. Then they had to fight their way inland for 700 miles to reach Berlin, the capital of Germany.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For nearly two years, the Allies planned the great invasion. Millions of people worked on it. Engineers invented new war machines. Factory workers produced new planes and tanks. Spies fed Hitler false reports. And nearly two million Allied soldiers trained hard in Britain.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet the whole invasion could fall apart. The Germans had built a wall of steel and concrete defenses up and down the coast. Could the first waves of Allied soldiers break through and gain control of the beaches and exit roads? That was the only way the rest of the troops could land.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the D-Day soldiers failed, all would be lost. There was no backup plan. The Allies had thrown everything they had into this one.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;D-Day&#x201d; is a code word for the day of any major military attack. But when people talk about &#x201c;D-Day&#x201d; now, they mean June 6, 1944. D-Day was a turning point in history&#x2014;it was the beginning of the end of World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b>:<b>The World at War</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Germany was one of the countries defeated in World War I. That war killed nearly ten million soldiers between 1914 and 1918. After Germany surrendered, its cities lay in ruins and its economy was in shreds. There were hardly any jobs. People were starving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then in 1933, Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi party, rose to power. He stamped out democracy, making himself the dictator of Germany. Freedom disappeared. Hitler named certain groups enemies, especially the Jews.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hitler built up a powerful army with millions of well-trained soldiers. Their weapons were the best in the world. Then he set plans to conquer all of Europe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and beyond.<br> &nbsp;<br> Without warning, in September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. First, bomber planes blasted Polish railroads, airfields, and telegraph lines. Then more than a million German ground troops plowed into Poland with tanks and heavy arms. This kind of attack&#x2014;bombing followed by a crush of tanks&#x2014;is called <i>lightning war</i>. The German word is <i>blitzkrieg,</i> or <i>blitz</i> for short.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> England and France immediately declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.<br> &nbsp;<br> England and France were no match for the powerful Hitler. After Poland fell, German troops crashed through Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. In June 1940, France itself fell to the Germans. The free world was in shock.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the other side of the world, Japan was overtaking lands in Asia and the Pacific. Japan signed an agreement with Germany in September 1940. Along with Italy, the three countries were called the Axis powers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile in Europe, British troops stood alone against Hitler. The United States shipped Britain arms, tanks, and planes. But for now, the United States did not send troops. More than 115,000 American soldiers had been killed in World War I. The country did not want to fight another war overseas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then on December 7, 1941, the Japanese led a surprise air attack against American forces at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. More than two thousand American troops died.&nbsp;<b> </b>The next day, US President Franklin Roosevelt declared war against Japan and its allies, including Germany.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> From then on, the United States played a key role in World War II. American men enlisted in huge numbers. The US military grew from 334,000 men at the beginning of the war to a force of twelve million.<br> &nbsp;<br> Overnight, the nation turned itself into a war factory. Thousands of warplanes, battleships, and arms were churned out and shipped overseas. In 1939, America made fewer than a thousand military planes a year. By the end of 1943, it produced eight thousand per <i>month</i>.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet Hitler and the Axis powers seemed unstoppable. Hitler overran almost all of Europe. His troops marched east into the Soviet Union. Japan seized countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Italy was winning battles in North Africa. At the beginning of 1942, news from the Allied war front was grim.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then slowly, one hard battle at a time, the Allies began to gain ground. Japan&#x2019;s advance was halted at a small island in the Pacific called Midway. The Soviets stopped Hitler&#x2019;s advance in Russia. Allied troops forced Italy out of Africa.

It&#x2019;s hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot&#x2019;s boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that&#x2019;s not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always.<br> <br>My dad loves Josh because he&#x2019;s a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it: all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it&#x2019;s like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he&#x2019;ll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby.<br> <br>Kitty loves Josh because he&#x2019;ll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other&#x2014;if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That&#x2019;s Kitty. Inevitably there won&#x2019;t be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he&#x2019;ll run out and buy some, because that&#x2019;s Josh.<br> <br>If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it&#x2019;s because we all do.<br> <br>We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There&#x2019;s paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, &#x201c;When Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, &#x2018;Pick any one of these breeds and we&#x2019;ll be good.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot and Josh are on the couch; I&#x2019;m lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it.<br> <br>A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn&#x2019;t give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, &#x201c;Margot, let&#x2019;s meet in Paris for my spring break!&#x201d; I&#x2019;m already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other.<br> <br>Margot&#x2019;s eyes light up. &#x201c;Do you think Daddy will let you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, it&#x2019;s culture. He&#x2019;ll have to let me.&#x201d; But it&#x2019;s true that I&#x2019;ve never flown by myself before. And also I&#x2019;ve never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel?<br> <br>Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I&#x2019;m with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I brighten. &#x201c;Yeah! We can stay at hostels and just eat pastries and cheese for all our meals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can go to Jim Morrison&#x2019;s grave!&#x201d; Josh throws in.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can go to a parfumerie and get our personal scents done!&#x201d; I cheer, and Josh snorts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, I&#x2019;m pretty sure &#x2018;getting our scents done&#x2019; at a parfumerie would cost the same as a week&#x2019;s stay at the hostel,&#x201d; he says. He nudges Margot. &#x201c;Your sister suffers from delusions of grandeur.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is the fanciest of the three of us,&#x201d; Margot agrees.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; Kitty whimpers.<br> <br>&#x201c;You?&#x201d; I scoff. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the least fancy Song girl. I have to beg you to wash your feet at night, much less take a shower.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kitty&#x2019;s face gets pinched and red. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t talking about that, you dodo bird. I was talking about Paris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Airily, I wave her off. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too little to stay at a hostel.&#x201d;<br> <br>She crawls over to Margot and climbs in her lap, even though she&#x2019;s nine and nine is too big to sit in people&#x2019;s laps. &#x201c;Margot, you&#x2019;ll let me go, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it could be a family vacation,&#x201d; Margot says, kissing her cheek. &#x201c;You and Lara Jean and Daddy could all come.&#x201d;<br> <br>I frown. That&#x2019;s not at all the Paris trip I was imagining. Over Kitty&#x2019;s head Josh mouths to me, We&#x2019;ll talk later, and I give him a discreet thumbs-up.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>It&#x2019;s later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty&#x2019;s good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn&#x2019;t speak to me because she&#x2019;s still convinced I&#x2019;m going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies.<br> <br>Margot&#x2019;s being extra quiet, and then, out of nowhere, she looks up from her computer and says, &#x201c;I broke up with Josh tonight. After dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>My cookie-dough ball falls out of my fingers and into the sugar bowl.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, it was time,&#x201d; she says. Her eyes aren&#x2019;t red-rimmed; she hasn&#x2019;t been crying, I don&#x2019;t think. Her voice is calm and even. Anyone looking at her would think she was fine. Because Margot is always fine, even when she&#x2019;s not.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why you had to break up,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Just &#x2019;cause you&#x2019;re going to college doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to break up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lara Jean, I&#x2019;m going to Scotland, not UVA. Saint Andrews is nearly four thousand miles away.&#x201d; She pushes up her glasses. &#x201c;What would be the point?&#x201d;<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t even believe she would say that. &#x201c;The point is, it&#x2019;s Josh. Josh who loves you more than any boy has ever loved a girl!&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I&#x2019;m being dramatic, but I&#x2019;m not. It&#x2019;s true&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl.<br> <br>Suddenly she says, &#x201c;Do you know what Mommy told me once?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I&#x2019;m better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn&#x2019;t have one memory of Mommy that we haven&#x2019;t given her. We&#x2019;ve told her so many stories so many times that they&#x2019;re hers now. &#x201c;Remember that time . . . ,&#x201d; she&#x2019;ll say. And then she&#x2019;ll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby.<br> <br>&#x201c;She told me to try not to go to college with a boyfriend. She said she didn&#x2019;t want me to be the girl crying on the phone with her boyfriend and saying no to things instead of yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Scotland is Margot&#x2019;s yes, I guess. Absently, I scoop up a mound of cookie dough and pop it in my mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t eat raw cookie dough,&#x201d; Margot says.<br> <br>I ignore her. &#x201c;Josh would never hold you back from anything. He&#x2019;s not like that. Remember how when you decided to run for student-body president, he was your campaign manager? He&#x2019;s your biggest fan!&#x201d;<br> <br>At this, the corners of Margot&#x2019;s mouth turn down, and I get up and fling my arms around her neck. She leans her head back and smiles up at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; she says, but she isn&#x2019;t, I know she isn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too late, you know. You can go over there right now and tell him you changed your mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>Margot shakes her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s done, Lara Jean.&#x201d; I release her and she closes her laptop. &#x201c;When will the first batch be ready? I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look at the magnetic egg timer on the fridge. &#x201c;Four more minutes.&#x201d; I sit back down and say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you say, Margot. You guys aren&#x2019;t done. You love him too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shakes her head. &#x201c;Lara Jean,&#x201d; she begins, in her patient Margot voice, like I am a child and she is a wise old woman of forty-two.<br> <br>I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot&#x2019;s nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. &#x201c;Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two.&#x201d; But even as I&#x2019;m saying it, I know it&#x2019;s not true. Margot&#x2019;s not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she&#x2019;s decided something, that&#x2019;s it. There&#x2019;s no waffling, no regrets. It&#x2019;s like she said: when she&#x2019;s done, she&#x2019;s just done.<br> <br>I wish (and this is a thought I&#x2019;ve had many, many times, too many times to count) I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I&#x2019;ll never be done.<br> <br>Later, after I&#x2019;ve washed the dishes and plated the cookies and set them on Kitty&#x2019;s pillow, I go to my room. I don&#x2019;t turn the light on. I go to my window. Josh&#x2019;s light is still on.</p><h2>Everything You Need to Know About Snakes</h2><p>From speedy slithering creatures and living dragons to snakes that fly and shed skin, <i>Everything You Need to Know About Snakes</i> explores the fascinating world of reptiles. <p>Readers will discover how far a cobra can spit, a gallery of fangs, how to survive a snake attack, the life cycle of a snake, and the Titanoboa &#x2014; a 50-foot-long prehistoric snake &#x2014; while also learning about lizards, crocodiles, tortoises, and turtles.

Care for the tree, and you might be surprised at how new things, and new ideas, bloom. </b><br><br> &#x201c;<b>Charms from cover to cover.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i></b>&nbsp;(Starred review)&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.&#x201d; In this imaginative take on that popular saying, a child is surprised (and disappointed) to receive a lemon tree from Grandma for her birthday. After all, she DID ask for a new gadget! But when she follows the narrator&#x2019;s careful&#x2014;and funny&#x2014;instructions, she discovers that the tree might be exactly what she wanted after all. This clever story, complete with a recipe for lemonade, celebrates the pleasures of patience, hard work, nature, community . . . and putting down the electronic devices just for a while.</p><p>Jamie L. B. Deenihan is a teacher and picture book author who lives with her husband and two children in Suffield, CT. <i>When Grandma Gives You a Lemon Tree</i> is her first picture book. Visit her online at jamiedeenihan.com.<br><br> Lorraine Rocha studied illustration and animation and worked at Lucasfilm&#x2019;s VFX and animation studio Industrial Light &amp; Magic, contributing to such films as <i>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i> and <i>Ironman</i>. She is the illustrator of <i>Zebra on the Go</i> by Jill Nogales (Peachtree). Lorraine lives with her husband and daughter in San Leandro, CA.&#x201c;Gardening tips abound in this delightful guide to caring for a lemon tree.&nbsp;The unnamed protagonist has a carefully drawn-out list of acceptable electronics she wants for her birthday. But Grandma instead brings...gasp...a lemon tree. The second-person text covers appropriate and inappropriate reactions and then advises readers to accept the potted present politely and wait for Grandma to leave or take a nap. Then you definitely shouldn&#x2019;t: drop it from a bridge, send it aloft with balloons, or &#x2018;play ding dong ditch&#x2019; with it (all illustrated with wry understatement). Instead, the narrator offers some incredibly important do&#x2019;s: put the fruit tree &#x2018;in a sunny spot&#x2019; (the grassy verge between sidewalk and street), don&#x2019;t overwater it, and &#x2018;battle against intruders&#x2019; who seem to come from all directions. After nearly a year of caring for her reluctantly received sapling, the protagonist joyously picks her lush lemons, and Grandma even returns to help make some fresh lemonade, the sale of which leads to more plants for her burgeoning garden. <b>Rocha&#x2019;s colors and characters leap right off the page, encouraging readers to get out into the world and create life, beauty, and some great-tasting lemonade (recipe included).</b> The community is diverse and urban, with no lack of personality and detail. The protagonist and Grandma are both black, she with black pigtail puffs and Grandma with a white poof of hair. <b>Charms from cover to cover</b>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus&nbsp;</i>(Starred review)<br><br> &#x201c;In this debut picture book, Deenihan offers a charmingly literal rendition of the proverbial phrase &#x2018;when life gives you lemons, make lemonade,&#x2019; with a colorful and cute story of a child who gets an unwanted birthday gift from grandma: a lemon tree. Once her mischievous plots to rid herself of the tree fail, a fruitful alternative arises: nurture the tree to make lemonade to sell in order to get what she really wants. In addition to the comical efforts of the girl, this playful picture book showcases the concept of delayed gratification. The girl truly has to wait for good things to come to fruition, and once they do, she makes some surprising choices (perhaps just what Grandma wanted). These concepts are enhanced by the eyecatching colors, bold cartoon figures with deeply expressive faces, and diverse cast of characters in Rocha's illustrations, which are filled with plenty of fun background details to pore over.

The nightmare ends the next morning, when Buzz awakens and finds what Fly Guy really created that night. For all the scary-monster thrills delivered here, there&#x2019;s reassurance, too: you can only be so afraid of a monster with a Band-Aid on his nose. Beginning readers will appreciate the vibrant art and simple text. Once again, Arnold takes a fresh approach to the theme of boy-and-his-pet affection that unifies the Fly Guy series.

Its formula is simple: just whiskey, bitters, sugar, and ice. But how you combine those ingredients&#x2014;in what proportion, using which brands, and with what kind of garnish&#x2014;is the subject of much impassioned debate.<br><br> <i>The Old-Fashioned </i>is the spirited, delightfully unexpected story of this renowned and essential drink: its birth as the ur-cocktail in the nineteenth century, darker days in the throes of Prohibition, re-ascension in the 1950s and 1960s (as portrayed and re-popularized by Don Draper on <i>Mad Men</i>), and renaissance as the star of the contemporary craft cocktail movement.<br><br> Also featured are more than forty cocktail recipes, including classic variations, regional twists, and contemporary updates from top bartenders around the country. All are accessible, delicious, and elegant in their simplicity, demonstrating the versatility and timelessness of the Old-Fashioned formula.&nbsp;<br><br> With its rich history, stunning photography, and impeccable recipes, <i>The Old-Fashioned</i> is a celebration of one of America&#x2019;s greatest bibulous achievements. It is a necessary addition to any true whiskey- or cocktail-lover&#x2019;s bookshelf, and destined to become a classic on par with its namesake beverage.</p><p><b>ROBERT SIMONSON, </b>journalist and author, is one of the leading authorities on spirits and cocktail culture in the United States. Called &#x201c;our man in the liquor-soaked trenches&#x201d; by the <i>New York Times</i>, he has written extensively about cocktails, spirits, bars, and bartenders for the Times, as well as <i>GQ, Wine Enthusiast, Wine Advocate, Imbibe, Edible Manhattan </i>and<i> Edible Brooklyn, </i>and<i> Time Out New York.</i> He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>Preface</b><br><br> &#x201c;I never treated it as just a cocktail.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Doris Simonson<br><br> My mother never drank liquor until she was twenty-one. She followed the rules. But when she embarked on what would become a long drinking life, she did so with purpose and not a little forethought.<br><br> The first order of business was to find her drink. In those post&#x2013;World War II days, when the cocktail hour was as inviolable a part of any day as sunrise and sunset, one had one&#x2019;s drink. There was none of this flitting about from cocktail to cocktail. You found a mix that delighted the palate and soothed the mind in the right proportions and stuck by it.<br><br> She began with Manhattans. She liked the way they looked, shining like liquid embers inside a long-stemmed glass. But, after a while, they gave her headaches, which she blamed on the sweet vermouth. (Vermouth is ever the scapegoat.) She then tried Martinis, but found them daunting and dangerous. Finally, she found her level in the Old-Fashioned. Some of her reasoning was spurious. She&#x2019;d ask for as much accompanying fruit as the bar could furnish as well as a healthy spurt of soda water, because, &#x201c;even in those days, watching your weight was important.&#x201d; But the remainder of her logic is hard to fault.<br><br> &#x201c;A lot depends on why you&#x2019;re having an Old-Fashioned,&#x201d; she said, some sixty years after she sampled her first. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re having one as a drink in the evening, you&#x2019;d probably rather have a strong one, because you&#x2019;re not going to have two Old-Fashioneds. If you&#x2019;re at somebody&#x2019;s home or visiting with people, it&#x2019;s never just a cocktail. I never treated it as just a cocktail. To me, a cocktail was an avenue to socializing. Everyone did it. It was something we did while we were visiting and laughing and singing and talking. It was a tool to meet people and relax.<br><br> &#x201c;I treated it as an all-purpose drink. I never went through this thing where you say, &#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s before dinner, so we need a before-dinner drink; or, it&#x2019;s dinner, so we want something light; or it&#x2019;s after dinner, etc.&#x2019; It was something I enjoyed drinking, and I could control what I wanted by telling the bartender not to put too much liquor in it, or to put a lot of fruit in it. You could almost make up the recipe for your Old-Fashioned.<br><br> &#x201c;You find people&#x2019;s personalities coming out in Old-Fashioneds. A lot of men will drink Old-Fashioneds, but they will tell the bartender, in no uncertain terms, &#x2018;Very little, if anything, mixed in.&#x2019; Mostly, it turned out what they wanted was a bourbon on the rocks. They basically wanted a nice strong drink with plenty of ice cubes, so as it sat there it became a little more mellow. Whereas women basically wanted all the things that went with it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And,&#x201d; she concluded, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s so beautiful to look at.&#x201d;<br><br>------------------<br><br>Col. Jim Gray&#x2019;s&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;OLD-FASHIONED WHISKEY COCKTAIL&nbsp;<br> <i>New York Sun</i>, 1908<br><br> &#x201c;Colonel&#x201d; Jim Gray enjoyed a thirty-year tenure behind the bar at New York&#x2019;s Fifth Avenue Hotel. He contended that he had served the Old-Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail since 1881 and had, in fact, invented it. This is the recipe given to a <i>New York</i> <i>Sun</i> reporter in 1908 by Colonel Gray himself. This formula is patently <i>not</i> an Old-Fashioned, what with the lack of bitters and lemon peel and the presence of nutmeg. Most likely, the reporter mistakenly applied the name to the recipe for a Whiskey Toddy, another drink for which Gray was famous. Indeed, several bartenders wrote to the <i>Sun</i> protesting that Gray must have been misquoted. Nonetheless, this is the recipe we have. And, taken as such, it&#x2019;s actually an excellent drink. The recipe below is adapted from Gray&#x2019;s instructions to the <i>Sun</i>.<br><br> 2 ounces bourbon or rye<br> 1 sugar cube<br> Dash of nutmeg<br><br> Muddle the sugar cube, a barspoon of water, and a sprinkle of nutmeg in a mixing glass. Add the whiskey and ice. Attach tin to top of glass and shake the drink. Strain the drink into an Old-Fashioned glass. Dust with nutmeg. &#x201c;And, for heavens sake,&#x201d; as the Colonel said, &#x201c;no bitters.&#x201d;</p><h2>Soda Pop Head</h2><p><p><em>There goes Lester.

But he lived at a time before the Civil Rights Movement, when the rules weren't fair to African Americans. Even though Jackie was a great athlete, he wasn't allowed on the best teams just because of the color of his skin. Jackie knew that sports were best when everyone, of every color, played together. He became the first black player in Major League Baseball, and his bravery changed African-American history and led the way to equality in all sports in America.<br><br> This engaging series is the perfect way to bring American history to life for young children, providing them with the right role models, supplemementing Common Core learning in the classroom, and best of all, inspiring them to strive and dream.</p><p>Brad Meltzer is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Heroes for My Son</i>, <i>Heroes for My Daughter</i>, and a number of suspense novels for adults. He is also the host of the History Channel television show <i>Brad Meltzer&#x2019;s Decoded</i>. He lives in Florida with his wife and their three children.<br>&nbsp;<br>Christopher Eliopoulos began his illustration career as a letterer for Marvel, and has worked on thousands of comics, including <i>Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius</i>, <i>Pet Avengers</i>, and <i>Cow Boy</i>, all of which he wrote and illustrated. He lives in New Jersey with his wife and their identical twin sons.K-Gr 3&#x2014;This title highlighting events from baseball star Jackie Robinson's life is a preachy, moralistic account of courage. Its sentimentality and sugary-sweetness are a throwback to motivational tales of a century ago. Meltzer is highly selective in his presentation. Facts, including names, dates, and places, are few and far between, and the theme of bravery overrides all else. Meltzer assumes readers have a basic knowledge of baseball, and many terms are not defined. Eliopoulos's cartoonish illustrations are corny and, as Jackie is always shown as a small child (a characteristic of this series), border on disrespectful. This book isn't complete or thorough enough for use as a biography, and the perky tone will likely cause eye-rolling among readers and listeners. There are many other more informative, better written books on Robinson that also emphasize the themes of courage and racial equality, such as Cathy Goldberg Fishman's When Jackie and Hank Met (Marshall Cavendish, 2012), a picture book that parallels the lives of Robinson and Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, and April Jones Prince's easy reader Jackie Robinson: He Led the Way (Penguin, 2007).&#x2014;Ann W.

It&#x2019;s the favorite village joke, and probably the only one, but it&#x2019;s not really true. At least I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s true, and neither does Gran. Really, my mother had another name for me, a wonderful name, but no one ever heard it. They only heard the first part. The worst part.<br> Mother had been very ill when I was born. Gran said she was fevered and coughing and I came before I was supposed to. Still, my mother held me close and whispered my name in my ear. No one heard it but me.<br> &#x201c;His name?&#x201d; Gran asked. &#x201c;Tell me his name.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;His name is Rump . . . haaa- cough- cough- cough . . .&#x201d; Gran gave Mother something warm to drink and pried me from her arms.<br> &#x201c;Tell me his name, Anna. All of it.&#x201d;<br> But Mother never did. She took a breath and then let out all the air and didn&#x2019;t take any more in. Ever. <br> Gran said that I cried then, but I never hear that in my imagination. All I hear is silence. Not a move or a breath. The fire doesn&#x2019;t crack and even the pixies are still.<br> Finally, Gran holds me up and says, &#x201c;Rump. His name is Rump.&#x201d;<br> The next morning, the village bell chimed and gnomes ran all over The Mountain crying, &#x201c;Rump! Rump! The new boy&#x2019;s name is Rump!&#x201d;<br> My name couldn&#x2019;t be changed or taken back, because in The Kingdom your name isn&#x2019;t just what people call you. Your name is full of meaning and power. Your name is your destiny.<br> My destiny really stinks.<br> I stopped growing when I was eight and I was small to begin with. The midwife, Gertrude, says I&#x2019;m small because I had only the milk of a weak goat instead of a strong mother, but I know that really it&#x2019;s because of my name. You can&#x2019;t grow all the way if you don&#x2019;t have a whole name.<br> I tried not to think about my destiny too much, but on my birthday I always did. On my twelfth birthday I thought of nothing else. I sat in the mine, swirling mud around in a pan, searching for gold. We needed gold, gold, gold, but all I saw was mud, mud, mud.<br> The pickaxes beat out a rhythm that rang all over The Mountain. It filled the air with thumps and bumps. In my head The Mountain was chanting, Thump, thump, thump. Bump, bump, bump. Rump, Rump, Rump. At least it was a good rhyme.<br> Thump, thump, thump<br> Bump, bump, bump<br> Rump, Rump, Rump<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Butt! Hey, Butt!&#x201d;<br> I groaned as Frederick and his brother Bruno approached with menacing grins on their faces. Frederick and Bruno were the miller&#x2019;s sons. They were close to my age, but so big, twice my size and ugly as trolls.<br> &#x201c;Happy birthday, Butt! We have a present just for you.&#x201d; Frederick threw a clod of dirt at me. My stubby hands tried to block it, but it smashed right in my face and I gagged at the smell. The clod of dirt was not dirt.<br> &#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s a gift worthy of your name!&#x201d; said Bruno.<br> Other children howled with laughter.<br> &#x201c;Leave him alone,&#x201d; said a girl named Red. She glared at Frederick and Bruno, holding her shovel over her shoulder like a weapon. The other children stopped laughing.<br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Frederick. &#x201c;Do you love Butt?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not his name,&#x201d; growled Red.<br> &#x201c;Then what is it? Why doesn&#x2019;t he tell us?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Rump!&#x201d; I said without thinking. &#x201c;My name is Rump!&#x201d; They burst out laughing. I had done just what they wanted. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not my real name!&#x201d; I said desperately.<br> &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t?&#x201d; asked Frederick.<br> &#x201c;What do you think his real name is?&#x201d; asked Bruno.<br> Frederick pretended to think very hard. &#x201c;Something unusual. Something special . . . Cow Rump.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Baby Rump,&#x201d; said Bruno.<br> &#x201c;Rump Roast!&#x201d;<br> Everyone laughed. Frederick and Bruno fell over each other, holding their stomachs while tears streamed down their faces. They rolled in the dirt and squealed like pigs.<br> Just for a moment I envied them. They looked like they were having such fun, rolling in the dirt and laughing. Why couldn&#x2019;t I do that? Why couldn&#x2019;t I join them?<br> Then I remembered why they were laughing.<br> Red swung her shovel down hard so it stuck in the ground right between the boys&#x2019; heads. Frederick and Bruno stopped laughing. &#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; she said.<br> Bruno swallowed, staring cross-eyed at the shovel that was just inches from his nose. Frederick stood and grinned at Red. &#x201c;Sure. You two want to be alone.&#x201d; The brothers walked away, snorting and falling over each other.<br> I could feel Red looking at me, but I stared down at my pan. I picked out some of Frederick and Bruno&#x2019;s present. I did not want to look at Red.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better find some gold today, Rump,&#x201d; said Red.<br> I glared at her. &#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m not stupid.&#x201d;<br> She raised her eyebrows. Some people did think I was stupid because of my name. And sometimes I thought they were probably right. Maybe if you have only half a name, you have only half a brain.<br> I kept my eyes on my pan of mud, hoping Red would go away, but she stood over me with her shovel, like she was inspecting me.<br> &#x201c;The rations are tightening,&#x201d; said Red. &#x201c;The king&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I know, Red.&#x201d;<br> Red glared at me. &#x201c;Fine. Then good luck to you.&#x201d; She stomped off, and I felt worse than when Frederick and Bruno threw poop in my face.<br> Red wasn&#x2019;t my friend exactly, but she was the closest I had to a friend. She never made fun of me. Sometimes she stood up for me, and I understood why. Her name wasn&#x2019;t all that great, either. Just as people laugh at a name like Rump, they fear a name like Red. Red is not a name. It&#x2019;s a color, an evil color. What kind of destiny does that bring?</p><h2>How I Met My Monster (I Need My Monster)</h2><p>One night, when Ethan reaches under his bed for a toy truck, he finds this note instead: &#x201c;Monsters!

This wacky celebration of underpants is perfect for reading aloud, and the hilarious antics of T. rex and the gang are endlessly entertaining. Featuring fun, vibrant art and short, rhyming text, <i>Dinosaurs Love Underpants </i>is a prehistoric pleasure parents and kids will want to read again and again.</p><p>Claire Freedman is the author of several picture books, including <i>Pirates Love Underpants!</i>; <i>Dinosaurs Love Underpants!</i>; <i>Aliens Love Underpants!</i>; <i>Snuggle Up, Sleepy Ones</i>; <i>One Magical Day</i>; <i>A Magical Christmas</i>; <i>Dilly Duckling</i>, and <i>My Grandparents Love Me</i>. She lives in Essex, England.<br><br>Ben Cort is the illustrator of several children&#x2019;s books, including <i>Aliens Love Underpants</i> and <i>Octopus&#x2019;s Garden</i>, which have been published in eighteen languages in twenty countries worldwide. Ben lives in Bedfordshire, England.PreS&#x2014;Freedman and Cort offer another homage to underpants. Cartoons in bright colors and patterns pep up the rhymed tale that explains the demise of dinosaurs. According to Freedman, "When T. rex saw man's undies,/He roared with deafening rants./I don't want to eat you up./I want your underpants." All dinosaurs follow the obsessive fad, escalating to a manic dino tug-of-war that wipes out every order, saving mankind. Despite the skimpy plot, preschoolers will giggle as itchy or tight briefs annoy Stegosaurus or Diplodocus, while theft victim cavemen shyly cover up with huge leaves or the few remaining pairs of underwear.&#x2014;<i>Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She's managed to make it to the fifth grade without anyone figuring out that she's not just an ordinary kid, and she wants to keep it that way.<br> <br> But then Nora gets fed up with the importance everyone attaches to test scores and grades, and she purposely brings home a terrible report card just to prove a point. Suddenly the attention she's successfully avoided all her life is focused on her, and her secret is out. And that's when things start to get really complicated....</p><p>Andrew Clements is the author of the enormously popular <i>Frindle</i>. More than 10 million copies of his books have been sold, and he has been nominated for a multitude of state awards,&nbsp;including two Christopher Awards and an Edgar Award. His popular works include <i>About Average</i>, <i>Troublemaker</i>, <i>Extra Credit, Lost and Found, No Talking, Room One, Lunch Money</i>, and more. He is also the author of the Benjamin Pratt &amp; the Keepers of the School series. He lives with his wife in Maine and has four grown children. Visit him at AndrewClements.com.Grade 4-7--Fifth-grader Nora Rowley has a problem with grades, and her latest report card, with five D's and one C, proves it. What nobody knows because she's kept it a secret is that she is really a genius and has earned those low marks on purpose because of her friend Stephen. She doesn't like the way tests make him feel about himself (dumb); plus, she can do without the stress as teachers prepare students for the state achievement test. The plan she hatches to sabotage test scores eventually begins to backfire, and the plot develops steadily around that crisis. Narrated by a very bright protagonist, the story has moments of engaging tension: Will the librarian disclose that Nora has been accessing college-level courses online? Will the school psychologist discover her high IQ and place her in the gifted program? Will she and Stephen be suspended for inciting a rebellion? This novel highlights the controversial issues of testing and grades from a child's point of view, but it also reveals the pressure that everyone, including teachers, administrators, and parents, feels. Clements's style, the large print, and the appealing cover illustration will easily capture the attention of even the most reluctant readers.<i>--Lee Bock, Glenbrook Elementary School, Pulaski, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stripped of their magical powers, the villains now live in total isolation, forgotten by the world.<br>Mal learns from her mother, Maleficent, that the key to true darkness, the Dragon's Eye, is located inside her scepter in the forbidden fortress on the far side of the island. The eye is cursed, and whoever retrieves it will be knocked into a deep sleep for a thousand years. But Mal has a plan to capture it. She'll just need a little help from her "friends."

A huge dome covers the island, keeping them from using any magic. They are relegated to eating scraps and wearing castoffs of the good citizens of Auradon, ruled by King Beast and Queen Belle. The children of Maleficient, Jabar, Evil Queen, and Cruella De Vil (respectively Mal, Jay, Evie, and Carlos) don't know any other life away from the island. Every aspect of their existence is focused on becoming more evil, and finding nefarious ways to entertain themselves. When Carlos invents a device that is meant to provide them with more cable channels, he inadvertently opens a hole in the dome, allowing a tiny bit of magic to reactivate Maleficient's scepter, the Dragon's Eye. The four go off on a quest to find the staff, each for their own selfish reasons. All the while, though, the descendants of the most evil villains to ever walk the earth are starting to (gasp!) show signs of caring for each other. And over on Auradon, Prince Ben, son of Beast and Belle, is having visions of a beautiful blue-haired girl he's never met, even though he's betrothed to Princess Audrey, daughter of Aurora. Clich�d characters and a predictable plot probably won't deter young readers from finishing this fun little romp through practically every Disney movie ever made. VERDICT Billed as a prequel to a Disney Channel movie, there's a built-in fan base for this story. Disney lovers and fairy-tale fans alike will need to get their hands on this book.&#x2014;Mandy Laferriere, Fowler Middle School, Frisco, TX</p><h2>Prada: The Complete Collections (Catwalk)</h2><p><b>A dazzling and authoritative look at three decades of Prada&#x2019;s groundbreaking fashion designs through stunning runway photography</b><br><br> Founded in 1913 as a leather-goods house in Milan, Prada entered the field of fashion when Miuccia Prada took the helm of the company in 1979.

One was sent up for tax evasion. Another, for skimming bingo profits. The third for a career-ending drunken joyride. Meeting daily in the prison law library, taking exercise walks in their boxer shorts, these judges-turned-felons can reminisce about old court cases, dispense a little jailhouse justice, and contemplate where their lives went wrong. Or they can use their time in prison to get very rich&#x2014;very fast.<br><br>And so they sit, sprawled in the prison library, furiously writing letters, fine-tuning a wickedly brilliant extortion scam&#x2014;while events outside their prison walls begin to erupt. A bizarre presidential election is holding the nation in its grips, and a powerful government figure is pulling some very hidden strings. For the Brethren, the timing couldn&#x2019;t be better. Because they&#x2019;ve just found the perfect victim.</p></p><p>John Grisham's novels have all been so systematically successful that it is easy to forget he is just one man toiling away silently with a pen, experimenting and improving with each book. While not as gifted a prose stylist as Scott Turow, Grisham is among the best plotters in the thriller business, and he infuses his books with a moral valence and creative vision that set them apart from their peers.<p> <i>The Brethren</i> is in many respects his most daring book yet. The novel grows from two separate subplots. In the first, three imprisoned ex-judges (the "brethren" in the title), frustrated by their loss of power and influence, concoct an elaborate blackmail scheme that preys on wealthy, closeted gay men. The second story traces the rise of presidential candidate Aaron Lake, a puppet essentially created by CIA director Teddy Maynard to fulfill Maynard's plans for restoring the power of his beleaguered agency. </p><p> Grisham's tight control of the two meandering threads leaves the reader guessing through most of the opening chapters how and when these two worlds will collide. Also impressive is Grisham's careful portraiture. Justice Hatlee Beech in particular is a fascinating, tragic anti-hero: a millionaire judge with an appointment for life who was rendered divorced, bankrupt, and friendless after his conviction for a drunk-driving homicide.</p><p> The book's cynical view of presidential politics and criminal justice casts a somewhat gloomy shadow over the tale. CIA director Teddy Maynard is an all-powerful demon with absolute knowledge and control of the public will and public funds. Even his candidate, Congressman Lake, is a pawn in Maynard's egomaniacal game of ad campaigns, illicit contributions, and international intrigue.

Jessie asked from the back seat, tapping the window glass three times. Jessie always tapped the window three times when they passed under a bridge.</p><b> </b>"Another hour," said Mrs. Treski. She glanced at the clock on the dashboard. "At least."<p></p><b> </b>They had already been driving for three hours, climbing steadily higher and higher into the mountains, and Jessie could feel herself sinking into a sulk. Everything about this trip to Grandma&#x2019;s house was different.<p></p><b> </b>First of all, Evan was sitting in the front seat.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie could tell he was listening to his iPod. From behind, she could see his head bobbing slightly to the beat of the music as he stared out the window.<p></p><b> </b>Evan had never been allowed to sit up front before. But this time, when he&#x2019;d asked&#x2015;for the ten thousandth time&#x2015;Mrs. Treski had given him a long, thoughtful look and said yes. He was ten and tall for his age, so Mrs. Treski said he was old enough to move up front.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie was nine&#x2015;and stuck in the back.<p></p><b> </b>"Hey," Jessie said, trying to get Evan to turn around and notice her. But he didn&#x2019;t. He couldn&#x2019;t hear her. It was like he wasn&#x2019;t even in the car with her.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie stared out the window at the farmland as it whizzed by them. Usually, she loved this drive. She loved to count things along the way&#x2015;cows, hawks, Mini Coopers, out-of-state license plates. She kept tally marks in her notebook, and at the end of the trip, she would count them all up to see who had won. It was almost always the cows.<p></p><b> </b>She also tracked their progress by looking for important landmarks along the way&#x2015;like the pest control building that had a forty-foot fiberglass cockroach creeping over the roof, or the two-story carved wooden totem pole that was really a cell phone tower, or the billboard for a diner that had a big metal teapot with real steam coming out of it.<p></p><b> </b>Evan used to be on the lookout for these landmarks, too, and it was a race to see who could spot each one first. But this year, he didn&#x2019;t seem to care. Even when the giant water storage tank painted like a ladybug came into view and Jessie pointed it out to him, he just shrugged, as if he couldn&#x2019;t be bothered. He was no fun, and suddenly the trip felt long.<p></p><b> </b>They passed under another bridge, and Jessie tapped the window three times. "Why did Grandma set her house on fire?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski&#x2019;s eyes shifted from the road to the rearview mirror, locking on Jessie&#x2019;s reflection for a second before returning to the highway. "She didn&#x2019;t mean to. It was an accident."<p></p><b> </b>"I know," said Jessie. "But why did it happen <i>this</i> time?"<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski tipped her head to one side. "Acci-dents happen. Sometimes there&#x2019;s no reason. She left something on the stove, and it caught on fire. It could happen to anyone."<p></p><b> </b>But it hadn&#x2019;t happened to her grandma before. Jessie thought about all the times Grandma had cooked noodles for her or made hot chocolate for her or heated up soup for her. Not once had she set the house on fire.<p></p><b> </b>It was because of the fire that they were driving up to Grandma&#x2019;s two days <i>after</i> Christmas instead of the day <i>before</i>, the way they always did. And it was because of the fire that they weren&#x2019;t even sure if they would be staying at Grandma&#x2019;s for New Year&#x2019;s Eve the way they did every year. And that was the really big thing that was different this time.<p></p><b> </b>For as long as Jessie could remember, New Year&#x2019;s Eve meant staying at Grandma&#x2019;s house and the long, slow climb to the top of Lovell&#x2019;s Hill, where the trees parted and the sky opened and there stood the old iron bell hanging on its heavy wooden crossbeam.<p></p><b> </b>Just before midnight they would gather, walking through the snow-covered woods, coming from all sides of the hill&#x2015;neighbors and friends, family and sometimes even strangers&#x2015;to sing the old songs and talk about the year gone by.<p></p><b> </b>And then, just before midnight, the youngest one in the crowd and the oldest one, too, would step forward and both take hold of the rope that hung from the clapper of the dark and heavy bell, and at precisely the right moment, they would ring in the New Year, as loudly and joyously and for as long as they wanted.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie remembered the year when <i>she</i> had been the youngest one on the hill, and what it felt like when Mrs. Lewis, who was eighty-four that year, had closed her soft, papery hand over hers. They had swung the rope back and forth, over and over, until the noise of the bell filled the snow-covered valley below and the echoes of each peal bounced off of Black Bear Mountain and came racing back to them, like an old faithful dog that always comes home.<p></p><b> </b>But this year, everything was upside down. They might not even spend New Year&#x2019;s Eve at Grandma&#x2019;s house. It all depended Mrs. Treski said. On what? Jessie wondered. She tapped her right knee twice. Not spend New Year&#x2019;s Eve at Grandma&#x2019;s? Who would ring the bell?<p></p><b> </b>Jessie jiggled her legs up and down. Her left foot was feeling prickly because she&#x2019;d had it tucked up under her for the last half-hour. "How much longer to the Crossroads Store?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>"Oh, Jessie . . ." said her mother, looking in the rearview mirror again. "Do you need to stop?"<p></p><b> </b>"What do you mean?" asked Jessie. It wasn&#x2019;t a question of whether she <i>needed to</i>&#x2015;although now that she thought of it, a trip to the bathroom sounded like a good idea. "We always stop at the Crossroads Store," she said, with a hint of a whine in her voice.<p></p><b> </b>"It&#x2019;s just that I thought this time we could drive straight through," said Mrs. Treski. "We&#x2019;re making such good time, and you know how the weather is in the mountains. You never know what might blow in."<p></p><b> </b>" Mo-o-om," said Jessie. Everything was messed up on this trip. "Evan, you want to stop at the Crossroads, don&#x2019;t you?"<p></p><b> </b>Evan just kept looking out the window, nodding his head in time to the music on his iPod.<p></p><b> </b>"Evan!" Jessie didn&#x2019;t mean to hit him quite so hard on the shoulder.<p></p><b> </b>"Quit it!" he said, turning around to glare at her.<p></p><b> </b>"I&#x2019;m asking you a question!" she shouted. Evan took out one of the ear buds and let it dangle from his ear like a dead worm on a hook. "Do you want to stop at the Crossroads?" Jessie couldn&#x2019;t help thinking the question sounded dumb. Of course he would want to stop.<p></p><b> </b>But Evan just shrugged and put the ear bud back in his ear. "I don&#x2019;t care."<p></p><b> </b>Jessie threw herself against the seat and folded her arms over her chest.<p></p><b> </b>"Relax, Jessie," said Mrs. Treski. "We&#x2019;ll stop. I could use a break to stretch my legs, anyway. But we can&#x2019;t stay too long. I don&#x2019;t want to get to Grandma&#x2019;s after dark." <b><p></p></b> *** <b><p></p></b> The Crossroads Store was a ten-minute detour off the main highway. It was on the corner of two roads that were so dinky, Mrs. Treski called it the intersection of Nowhere and Oblivion. But the store itself was miraculous. It was a combination gas station, deli, bakery, gift shop, bookshop, hunting/fishing/clothing store, and post office. They sold kayaks, guns, taxidermied animals, hunting knives, Get Well cards, umbrellas, joke books, night crawlers, candy, and decorative wall calendars. Jessie could wander the store for hours, wishing she had the money to buy just about everything.<p></p><b> </b>She only had five dollars in her pocket, though. That was all the money she&#x2019;d allowed herself to bring on this trip. Back home in her lock box, she had almost thirty dollars. Most of that was from the money she&#x2019;d made during the lemonade war, or at least what was left over after she made that $104 contribution to the Animal Rescue League. ("You don&#x2019;t have to give as much as I did," Megan had said, but Jessie had insisted. "I said I was going to, and I&#x2019;m going to," she said, even though it almost killed her to give all that money away&#x2015;and to animals!)<p></p><b> </b>But no matter how enticing everything in the Crossroads Store looked to her (a squirrel nutcracker! fake mustaches!), Jessie wasn&#x2019;t about to spend thirty dollars. She liked to have money saved. Just in case.<p></p><b> </b>After using the bathroom, she walked over to where Evan was standing, halfway between the deli and the bakery. He was looking at fancy gift bags of candy, all done up with curlicue ribbons.<p></p><b> </b>"Look!" he said, holding up a bag. It was a bag of chocolate-covered blueberries, named Moose Droppings. "Want some?" he asked, dangling the bag in front of her face.<p></p><b> </b>"That is so gross!" Jessie said. But she loved it. The candy really did look exactly like moose droppings, only smaller. On closer inspection, she saw that there were also chocolate-covered cranberries and chocolate-covered raisins. "Are you going to get a bag? We could split one. Which one do you think is the best?" But Evan had wandered off and wasn&#x2019;t listening to her anymore.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie put the bag back on the shelf and walked over to the corner of the store devoted to jigsaw puzzles. There were a dozen puzzles to choose from, but Jessie&#x2019;s eyes went immediately to the one that was a picture of jellybeans. The brightly colored candies looked like rocks on a pebbly beach, and Jessie knew the puzzle would be hard to do. It had a thousand pieces!<p></p><b> </b>"Jessie, are you ready?" asked her mother, shoving a few dollars back into her wallet after paying for the gas.<p></p><b> </b>"Can we get this? Please?" asked Jessie, pulling the jellybean puzzle down from the shelf. "For Grandma?" Jessie and Grandma always worked on jigsaw puzzles when the family visited, and Jessie often brought a new puzzle for them to try. They had never done a thousand-piece puzzle, though.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie&#x2019;s mom paused, the money still hanging out from her wallet. Jessie knew her mom had to be careful with money, and she tried hard not to ask for things she didn&#x2019;t need. "I have five dollars," said Jessie. "I could chip in."<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski took the puzzle and said, "It&#x2019;s a good idea, Jess. You and Grandma can work on it when she gets home from the hospital."<p></p><b> </b>Jessie smiled, glad she could have the puzzle without spending her own money, and turned to the circular spinning postcard rack that was next to the jigsaw puzzles. There were eight columns of cards, and Jessie liked to make the rack squeak as she turned it slowly. She started at the top and began to work her way straight down one column, and then went back up to the top of the next column. She didn&#x2019;t want to miss a single card.<p></p><b> </b>"Jess, can we go now?" asked her mother, looking through the various compartments of her wallet as if money would magically appear if she looked hard enough.<p></p><b> </b>"No, I&#x2019;m looking at the cards," said Jessie.<p></p><b> </b>"You must own every card on that rack."<p></p><b> </b>"Sometimes they have a new one," said Jessie.<p></p><b> </b>"Five minutes, okay? Five minutes, I want to be pulling out of the parking lot." Mrs. Treski walked off to the checkout counter to pay for the puzzle.<p></p><b> </b>Why was her mom so impatient? Usually she loved to stop at the Crossroads, but this time it was all about making good time and getting back on the road. Well, Jessie wasn&#x2019;t going to be rushed. She finished looking at the second column of postcards, and then started on the third.<p></p><b> </b>"Ever been there?"<p></p><b> </b>Jessie looked up. An old man with a stubbly beard was squinting through his glasses at a postcard that showed the Olympic Stadium in Lake Placid. Jessie noticed that the glasses sat crooked on his face. "The stadium where they had the Olympics? Ever been there?"<p></p><b> </b>Jessie shook her head. "No."<p></p><b> </b>The man tapped the card. "I was there in 1980 <i>and</i> 1932. Yes, I was. I saw Sonja Henie win the gold medal for figure skating. Do you believe that?" He nodded his head up and down as if he could make her do the same.<p></p><b> </b>Wow, 1932! How could anyone be that old? Jessie looked closely at the man standing beside her. He started to scratch his face like he had a bad rash. "Were you in the Olympics?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>"No!" said the man, "but I had dreams." He was nodding his head more vigorously now&#x2015;nodding and scratching&#x2015;and his eyes were locked on the far end of the store.<p></p><b> </b>"Hey, Jess, come on," said Evan, grabbing hold of one elbow and pulling her toward the door.<p></p><b> </b>"I&#x2019;m not done!" she said. But Evan didn&#x2019;t let go of her until they were outside. When Jessie looked back through the window, she saw that the man was still scratching his face and talking, even though no one was near.<p></p><b> </b>"That guy was crazy," Evan said, matter-of-factly.<p></p><b> </b>"How do you know?" asked Jessie, looking up at her big brother.<p></p><b> </b>Evan shrugged and put his headphones back on. "You can just tell."<p></p><b> </b>But Jessie couldn&#x2019;t tell. It hadn&#x2019;t occurred to her that there was anything wrong with the old man. Why did old people get like that? Did something break down inside their heads, the way a shoelace eventually snaps after being tied too many times? And how exactly did Evan know?<p></p><b> </b>As soon as they got back on the highway, it started to snow. At first the flakes were large and wet, sticking for an instant to the windshield like giant white moths before dissolving into quarter size drops of water. Then the snow became steadier and more fierce, and the ground on either side of the highway turned white and shapeless. It was dusk when they pulled up to the end of Grandma&#x2019;s long, winding driveway and got their first look at the house.<p></p><b> </b>"Oh my," said Mrs. Treski, turning off the ignition and letting the car lights die.</p><h2>Lunch Lady and the Cyborg Substitute: Lunch Lady #1</h2><p><b>From the author of National Book Award finalist&nbsp;<i>Hey, Kiddo</i>.</b><br><br>Serving justice . . . and lunch!<br><br> Hector, Terrence, and Dee have always wondered about their school lunch lady.

Krosoczka is the author-illustrator of <i>Punk Farm, Punk Farm on Tour, Max for President, </i>and <i>Baghead. </i>He lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.This tongue-in-cheek superheroine graphic novel will hit the spot for chapter-book readers. Lunch Lady and Betty, her assistant in both the cafeteria and her role of wrong-�righting supersleuth, investigate the strange case of an absent teacher, his creepy substitute, and a plan to grab the Teacher of the Year Award by truly foul means. Three little kids join in the action as Lunch Lady, equipped with a variety of high-tech kitchen gadgets like a spatu-copter and a lunch-tray laptop, tracks a cleverly disguised robot to his maker&#x2019;s lab, where a whole army of cyborgs require kicking, stomping, and the wielding of fish-stick nunchucks. Yellow-highlighted pen-and-ink cartoons are as energetic and smile-provoking as Lunch Lady&#x2019;s epithets of &#x201c;Cauliflower!&#x201d; and Betty&#x2019;s ultimate weapon, the hairnet. There is a nice twist in the surprise ending, and the kids&#x2019; ability to stand up to the school bully shows off their newfound confidence in a credible manner.

Among her many awards, Julia has received the Association for Educational Publishers Distinguished Achievement Award, and her books have been honored by The National Parenting Center and Mom s Choice Awards.I think this should be mandatory reading for anyone who deals with kids with Autism and families of kids with Autism. . . Great resources that teachers should have in their classroom to teach acceptance and differences. --Maria's Space Blog<br><br>This is probably one of the better books I have read to help children understand other children on the Autism Spectrum. It says that spectrum are uniquely wired and do things with a purpose we may not understand. Such as heavy focus on one thing like watches or trains. The need for headphones, or why sounds hurt, etc. One thing I liked at first but was annoyed with by the end were the lessons that Zac teaches us. To be patient, to look at things from a different perspective. What annoys me is the Thank you Zac. It gets repetitive. It works, and I think every library, and probably school should have a copy of this book. --Ryan Franklin, Librarian<br><br>Instead of depicting autism as a disadvantage, Cook portrays Zak as having many gifts to share due to his uniquely wired brain. Zak has many features that are typical of people with autism, including avoiding eye contact, rapid body movements, an incredible memory, deep passions (trains, watches), and a tendency to repeat phrases. The people in his life, from siblings to teachers, support him and thank him for the patience he teaches them. In creating a positive context around autism and highlighting Zak s similarities and differences, neurotypical students can gain a new perspective. DuFalla s bright cartoon pictures match the upbeat tone of the text and will engage readers. A list of tips for understanding children who are uniquely wired is also included.

My mother is afraid I&#x2019;m sick, and the Americans will turn us away when we get to New York City, but my grandmother said don&#x2019;t worry: now that my father has his American job, no one can turn us away. She said it&#x2019;s just the excitement taking away my appetite. For once my gjyshe is wrong about something: It&#x2019;s not excitement that keeps me from eating my dinner, it&#x2019;s worry. I keep wondering: What if I don&#x2019;t know my own baba when I see him at the airport? It&#x2019;s been almost one year since we are together with my father. The more I think about it, the more worried I get. </p><p>Finally, on the day we are leaving for New York, I get so tired of worrying, I eat a big bowl of delicious trahana my grandmother makes for me. While I eat, I think to myself: this is the last food I will taste in my country. </p><p>Our plane lands in New York in the middle of the night. At the airport, I can feel how hot New York is compared to the Balkans. Even the air feels different on my skin, sticky and wet. I close my eyes for a minute and take a breath. I think to myself, Now I am breathing American air. </p><p>Even though it&#x2019;s the middle of the night, this place is crowded with people. Then I see him: his face is all furry with a red beard he is growing, and he looks thinner, but he is still wearing his Albanian clothes. Now I know it was silly to worry so much. Of course I know my own father. </p><p>&#x201c;Mir� se erdh�t,&#x201d; my father shouts, welcoming us, and sweeps my mother and my baby brother up into his arms. My mother is crying and we are kissing him so much. My mother cried every day that we were in Kosova because we had to be separated from Baba for so long. For one year my father was alone in America, getting money for us to come here. Maybe now that we are together in New York City, she will stop her crying.My father kisses me on top of my head, and we follow him through the airport to the garage where he parked his taxicab. When we learned that my father&#x2019;s first American job was as a car driver, we were all sad that a man who had trained as an electrical engineer had to take a job that was s&#x2019;�sh t� n� dinjitetin e tij&#x2014;not good enough for him. But when I saw my father&#x2019;s taxicab, I thought it was lucky my father&#x2019;s first American job was as a driver. Now we would have a pretty yellow cab to take us to our new home, just like in a movie. </p><p>I look over at my grandmother. Gjyshe hasn&#x2019;t said a word since we got off the plane, except to nod hello to her son. Now she looks at me and smiles a smile so big that it covers her whole face. </p><p>&#x201c;America the beautiful!&#x201d; she says in English. </p><p>Sometimes from the way she smiles and tells jokes, my gjyshe seems more like a girl eight years old than an old lady almost seventy. </p><p>My father opens the trunk and puts our bags inside while the rest of us pile into the car. </p><p>My grandmother, brother and I are in the backseat and my mother is in front. </p><p>&#x201c;Zonj�!&#x201d; says my father and makes a little bow. Inside, the car smells sweet, like perfume. Gjyshe and I watch silently as my father drives the car down the ramps and tunnels of the airport. Soon we are on the streets, with the lights of America everywhere around us. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Book of Proverbs - Alabaster Bible</h2><p><b> The Bible Beautiful. </b>The entire Book of Proverbs in one 120 page book.15pt cover paper (soft-touch aqueous coating). 80lb text paper(uncoated) for interior pages.

But how do we use that information? What do we do with all of that knowledge? How do we apply it for the good of humanity? We need wisdom to help us sort it all out.<br><br>The Book of Proverbs is one of the most well-known collections of Biblical wisdom. Historically, it was passed down from adults to young children, teaching morality, the meaning of life, and that "the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom." Proverbs is one of the four books in the Old Testament that explores biblical wisdom-teaching us the aim and essence of a good and beautiful life. <br><br>The Book of Proverbs isn't just a list of how-tos. It is poetic art, using metaphor and literary devices to teach us about the nature of wisdom. We designed this book with these literary tools in mind, using imagery to help today's reader experience a fresh perspective that is closer to what the original Hebrew poetry intended.<br><br>The Hebrew word for Wisdom is Chokmah, and it isn't just wisdom that you develop by attaining intellectual knowledge. Chokmah is used to describe a skilled artisan, who is putting wisdom to work and being developed. Proverbs teaches us more than just the nature of wisdom--it illustrates a beautiful outlook on the world, offers principles for wise living, and ultimately, gives us a glimpse into how God sees humanity. The beauty of Proverbs is that we can come back to a principle or proverb again and again, each time gaining different insight.<br><br>Art, whether it's dance, painting, design, or in this case poetry, is able to speak to the complexities of our lives in extraordinary ways. The Book of Proverbs does just that. We can't wait to show you Proverbs in a new, visual way.Alabaster Co. began late one night when friends Bryan Chung and Brian Chung were deep in discussion on creativity and God. Reflecting on the direction culture was taking toward visual images, innovation and design, an idea was born: create a brand passionate about fully exploring the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith. Realizing that beauty is a foundational value when talking about creativity and God, they decided to name the company Alabaster, after one of the only times Jesus uses the word beautiful in the Gospels. In Mark 14:1-9, a woman breaks an alabaster jar of incredibly expensive perfume onto Jesus&#39; head. Many people in the room scoff at her and say what she has done is a complete waste. But Jesus defends the woman saying, &#34;leave her alone, why do you bother her? What she has done is a beautiful thing.&#34; It is this complete act of sacrificial giving which Jesus calls - in the original greek - kalos, which literally means beautiful as a sign of inward goodness. We wanted to have this same level of intentionality and thoughtfulness as the woman did as we created Alabaster. Alabaster was officially launched on Kickstarter in October 2016 with its first project: Alabaster: The Bible Beautiful. After a successful launch, the books were printed and a conversation began. Since then, we&#39;ve put the books on Amazon, made new projects and are planning for the future, all with the same passion: explore the intersection of creativity, beauty, and faith for the sake of a more beautiful human flourishing.</p><h2>All the Ways to be Smart</h2><p><p>A tender, funny, and exquisitely illustrated picture book celebrating all the unique and wonderful qualities that make children who they are.</p> <p>With heartwarming rhyming text all about knowing what makes you special, <em>All the Ways to Be Smart</em> is a wonderful introduction to conversations about self-esteem.</p></p><p><p>Davina Bell is a writer from Western Australia.

Judge writes with a simple clarity that avoids any preachiness, and the streamlined emotion will resonate with young listeners. . . . The watercolor and pencil illustrations are warm, robust, and thoughtfully composed. . . . Penguin is a charmingly tubby and stout guy, and the skillful positioning of his red flight goggles visually convey his emotions: when he's happy, the earpieces flip up jauntily, and when he's sad, they dejectedly droop. This could be a useful tool for many kinds of discussions--from the adaptations that some kids need in a classroom, to creative problem solving, to perseverance--or a cheerful addition to a unit or story hour about birds or penguins."--Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, June 2014, *STARRED REVIEW*</p><h2>Your Birthday Book: A Keepsake Journal</h2><p>Start this at birth, wrap it up at eighteen, fill it out each year in between.<br><br>This is not anything like a baby book.

We believed the focus would mainly be on updating the screenshots from Excel to Power BI, adding a few touch-ups here and there, and we would be done. How wrong we were!<br><br>As soon as we started updating the first chapter, we quickly discovered that we wanted to rewrite pretty much everything. We felt so not only in the first chapter, but at every page of the book. Therefore, this is not really a 2nd edition; it is a brand-new book.<br><br>The reason is not that the language or the tools have changed so drastically. The reason is that over these last few years we - as authors and teachers - have evolved a lot, hopefully for the better. We have taught DAX to thousands of users and developers all around the world, we have worked hard with our students, always striving for the best way to explain complex topics. Eventually, we did find different ways of describing the language we love.<br><br>We increased the number of examples, showing practical uses of the functionalities after teaching the theoretical foundation of DAX. We tried to use a simpler style, without compromising on precision. We fought with the editor to increase the page count, as this was needed to cover all the topics we wanted to share. Nevertheless, we did not change the leitmotif of the book: we assume no previous knowledge of DAX on the reader's part, even though this is not a book for the casual DAX developer. This is a book for people who really want to learn the language and gain a deep understanding of the power and complexity of DAX.<br><br>Yes, if you want to leverage the real power of DAX, you need to be prepared for a long journey with us...

Perhaps the most stirring and transcendent heaven story since Field of Dreams.&#x201d; &#x2014;Matthew Quick,&nbsp; author of <em>The Good Luck of Right Now</em></p></p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: Nicholas Sparks and Mitch Albom</b></p> <p><strong>Nicholas Sparks is the best-selling author of several beloved novels, with over 80 million copies in print worldwide. His most recent release is The Longest Ride</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Nicholas Sparks: </strong>We first met years ago, when <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> and <i>The Notebook</i> were just out. What&#x2019;s been the most surprising turn for your career since that day?</p> <p><strong>Mitch Albom:</strong> Pretty much everything. <i>Tuesdays</i> was the first nonsports thing I had done, and it was written only to pay Morrie&#x2019;s medical bills. I figured I&#x2019;d return to sportswriting. I never imagined novels or the audience I&#x2019;ve been blessed to find. I remember you hoping <i>The Notebook</i> would give you more chances to write. I think you&#x2019;ve done OK with that, by the way.</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Thanks. With this new novel, The <i>First Phone Call from Heaven</i>, heaven once again figures prominently&#x2014;as it did in <i>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</i>. How do you use it differently this time?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Five People</i> mostly takes place in heaven, to teach Eddie, the protagonist, to appreciate his life on earth. <i>First Phone Call</i> takes place in a small town, with the idea of heaven reaching out to us down here&#x2014;through the phone.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> You wove the story of Alexander Graham Bell&#x2019;s invention of the telephone into this novel. Do you see parallels between that and our modern-day obsession with cell phones? How did this influence your story development?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> People scoffed at the telephone&#x2019;s invention. Yet once it was introduced, its growth was astronomical. Same thing with cell phones. I used this to show how the &#x201c;once impossible&#x201d; is quickly forgotten. Could the same be true about speaking to heaven?</p> <p><strong>NS: </strong>Hearing from a deceased loved one is such a powerful idea. Whom would you talk to if you had the chance? And if Morrie from <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i> were one, what would you ask him? </p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> My mother is still alive, but has suffered several strokes and can&#x2019;t speak. I wish I could dial to the past and engage in one of our long, impassioned, all-over-the-place talks. And Morrie? Well. He never got to read a page of <i>Tuesdays</i>. I&#x2019;d ask if he is pleased. Am I doing OK by him? Mostly, I&#x2019;d like to hear his laughter. I think we miss laughter most. </p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> This is the first novel you&#x2019;ve written with a mystery/thriller element. Did that change your writing process at all? And is this how you think the world would really react&#x2014;global fascination&#x2014;if proof of heaven were somehow revealed?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> It felt quite natural to weave a mystery&#x2014;perhaps from all those years&#x2019; writing sports that count down and reach a climax. And yes, I definitely think if a town today claimed to be talking to heaven, it would be on twenty-four hours a day on cable news and the Internet. Look at the Susan Boyle story. In a week, the whole world knew of her&#x2014;and she just sang like an angel. Imagine talking to one!</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Small towns&#x2014;like Coldwater in <i>First Phone Call</i>&#x2014;often paint the backdrop of your novels. Why?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> I was raised in a small town&#x2014;local high school, one great pizza place, everyone knowing everyone. So it&#x2019;s familiar. Also, secrets in a small town are hard to keep&#x2014;and often shocking when revealed. My stories are about people&#x2014;and sometimes secrets. A small town is a good canvas.</p> <p><strong>NS:</strong> Now that you have so many more books than just <i>Morrie</i>&#x2014;unlike when we first met&#x2014;do you have a favorite among them?</p> <p><strong>MA:</strong> <i>Tuesdays</i> will always be my favored child&#x2014;because it so changed my life. But storywise, <i>Five People</i> means a great deal, because everyone told me I was crazy&#x2014;don&#x2019;t write a novel. I broke every piece of advice. And people embraced the story. That&#x2019;s extremely rewarding.</p><p><em>"What if the end is not the end?" </em></p><p>From the beloved author of the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>Tuesdays with Morrie</em> and <em>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</em> comes his most thrilling and magical novel yet&#x2014;a page-turning mystery and a meditation on the power of human connection.</p><p>One morning in the small town of Coldwater, Michigan, the phones start ringing.
